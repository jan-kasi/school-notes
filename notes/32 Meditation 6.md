# 32 Meditation 6

## Earlier Meditations:
Intellect
- used in 2 senses:
  - Before M4, a passive vessel which holds ideas to be acted on by the will to form judgements
  - In M4&M6, used to mean the whole process
Clear and Distinct Perception
-


I am a thinking thing/I am, I exist is a self verifying thought 

## p1-4

### p1

### p2
Distinction between imagination as visualisation of an idea in the mind's eye, and pure understanding.


### p3
Imagining isn't part of my essence, as "I should undoubtedly remain the same individual as I now am", i.e. it doesn't depend on me.  Position that: self is within the mind, and not linked to body.
It must therefore depend on something which isn't the mind. If there is some body my mind is joined to that it can contemplate it

### p4


## p5-15

### Stage 1: Sensations come from outside me (59-60)
The nature of the ideas leads me to think they are external

They are much more vivid than ideas I reason about and more distinct, it "seems impossible that they should come from within me"
Therefore they must come from other things.
The only source of my knowledge of them is the idea itself, so it "was bound to occur to me" that the thing they come from resembles them.

The phenomenological experience of factitious/etc ideas are different to sensations.

### Stage 2: Sensations come from outside me (59-61)
The lack of control leads me to think they are external.
> "my experience was that these ideas came to me quite without my consent"

> "These and other judgements that i made concerning sensory objects, I was apparently taught to make by nature"

Hunger.
No control over them, they cannot come from himself.
I cannot give an explanation for why the sensation is caused.
I am aware of pain and it "gives rise to a particular distress of mind".

I perceived through my senses my body, and its sensations, and sensations of things appearing to be outside me

I couldn't have sensory awareness if I wanted to, I can only have it if it is present in my sense organs

### Stage 3: Sensations originate in matter (60-63)
"without my cooperation and ... against my will" (bottom of 62). Apprehension is triggered by the sensation (which is external in matter)
Link to mind/body distinction, it isn't in mind it is in body (matter)
"the only alternative is that there is another substance distinct from me"

### Stage 4: Material objects possess mathematical and geometric properties (61-66)

"for the...conception of them includes extension, but does not include any intellectual act whatsoever"
