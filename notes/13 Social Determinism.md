# 13 Social Determinism

Edward Colston (participated in slavery) v. John Wesley (opposed slavery)

>  “Colston was a product of his time”
Is a stupid and flawed argument to defend him. While it is true that the society was pro-slavery and pushed individuals to conform, it is not the case that one was determined to conform as evidenced by the exisence of John Wesley and other abolitionists. Further, conforming to society because "that was just the way it was" does not exculpate one, only explain (link to pinker). To claim Colston was a partial product of his time, combined with other things such as personal decisions and other factors, might be more accurate but still does not excuse his actions.

Marx: we are socially and economically determined but we can change this.
