# Content, craft and Conventions
- For IB, a large part of assessment is appreciation of the writer's craft and their artistic choices
  - how they communicate the content of what they say and depict to the reader
  - e.g. literary techniques; irony; characterisation;
  - be clear: **remember that the examiner has not been in your lessons!**

We cannot separate what the things are from how the writer presents them, they do not exist as they are until they are created by the writer
