# Titles
As a way into poems
Titles
- Often overlooked
- Clues into subject matter
- Can be an ironic contrast to the actual subject matter
- First impression we get, so important
- Deliberately obscuring or misleading
- Can be absent

## Contemplating titles: activity

- *Lady Lazarus* Sylvia Plath
- *Queen Kong* Carol Ann Duffy
- *A*nthem for the Doomed Yuth* Wilfred Owen
- *Funeral Blues* WH Auden
- *Nothing Gold can Stay* Robert Frost

- *For Women Who are Difficult to Love* Warsan Shire
- *Borgues and I* Jorge Luis Borgues


*Borgues and I* by Jorgue Luis Borgues.
The title evokes the idea of introducing someone or telling a story of two different people; however, the poet and narrator are both Borgues. This suggests a divide or duality, this might be explored in the poem through Brgues as an author or public figure---the use of the surname reminds the reader of how someone writes about someone in the public or in formal writing--and Borgues as "I": as the actual Borgues who is known to himself as "I" and not as the public "Borgues". The title also appears formal in refering to Borgues but friendly in that the narrator and author know each other to refer to themselves as "Borgues and I", perhaps as a union or acquaintance. This suggests that even though Borgues as a formal figure is not the same person as the private Borgues, or "I", they are still together and known to ech other in some way. Perhaps this contrast between difference and similarity will be explored. "I" is an immediate reality while "Borgues" is more of an idea---the surname insead of a first name suggests that he is also almost a concept of a person. The idea of Borgues as a figure or concept and not a real person might also be a theme which is further explored in the poem.
