# 12 Meditation 2

The cogito: A necessity—the necessary connection between thought and existence

### p21 onward

The question of human nature

Going through what the everyday person goes through and how the Cartesian method has changed about 

Lots of thinking and mental conceptions –> I could doubt *what* I think but not that I *am* thinking

Doesn’t justify everything because he has already done so in M1 and they are contemporary ideas too.



### p22 onward

Reintroducing the res cogitas and cogito to the Cartesian Skepticism and holding it up



#### key quotes

“thought—this alone is inseparable from me”

“I am, then, in the strict sense only, a thing that thinks”

“I am, I exist—that is certain”

#### Descartes argument:

If you suppose there is a malicious deceiver, then all the things attributed to the body and soul are uncertain and doubtful except for thought

Thought is the only essential property (so far), without thought one does not exist, therefore one is (strictly) a thinking thing

#### s

Locke







‘D is proving *his* point, not *the* point’
