# Critical theory

- can be useful for unseen texts in paper 1
- think about class texts in different ways
- how texts are constructed
- how literary texts function, influence and are influenced by society


- ***DON'T*** list all the theories you know and say what they would say
  - not "a feminist critic would see...however a poststructuralist...and a psychoanalytic/analytic psychologistt would..."
- instead:
  - notice these themes and integrate them into your writing as your own, noticing as you do the critical theory you're using
  - be aware of theories to inform what you will discuss
