# 03 Challenges to the Existentialist position

| Issue                                             | Analysis                                                     | Ranking |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| Postmodern nature ==> extreme moral relativism.   | Just because one does not like MR doesn’t mean it is bad/invalidate existentialism | low     |
| Very hard to be authentic self/luxury             | Sartre admits this. This is however quite elitist, some do not have the luxury to go through anxiety.<br />Also “we are condemned to be free”. t might be better to conform to society/social contract. | medium  |
| Is freedom really being authentic self            | Is **trying** to be your authentic self a limiting way to freedom/ not being authentic self by trying.<br />Is it a self defeating position to try and be authentic/ closed circle loop. | higher  |
| Some might be happier leading a meaningless life. | “It is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool dissatisfied” BUT IN REVERSE :O | lower   |
| Is it possible to know our authentic self?        | Effect of society shapes us, we are not in a vacuum where only existence defines our essence.<br />A little like the gaze/ the look not allowing us to even KNOW our authentic self. | higher  |
|                                                   |                                                              |         |
|                                                   |                                                              |         |
|                                                   |                                                              |         |
|                                                   |                                                              |         |

##### Side note: Foucault

The family unit is a tool of state power. The family unit is a constraint.



##### Side note end

- existentialism and ethics of personal responsibility only work if everyone agrees.
  - Unreasonable expectations of others
  - This doesn’t work
- Some people are biologically affected/limited





## Galen Strawson

1. You do what you do—in the circumstances you find yourself—because of the way you are
2. If you're ultimately responsible for what you do, you are ultimately responsible for the way you are—at least in some mental aspects
3. So if you’re going to be ultimately responsible for what you do, you’re going to have to be ultimately responsible for the way you are—at least in certain mental respects.
4. But you can’t be ultimately responsible for the way you are (you cannot be *causa sui*, the cause of yourself)
5. So you can’t be ultimately responsible for what you do.

But, why can you not be causa sui for some things and not others? e.g. you can be *causa sui* for the way you think about things (or perhaps not?) or attained skills etc. (?)



***Any*** infringement on absolute (ontological) freedom is damning to existentialism.
