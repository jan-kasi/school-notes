# 16 Wittgenstain continued

- Individual experience **informs** truth
- anti-realist: there is no way we can access truth of the external world, it can only come from us
- non-cognitive: every langiage game is an expression of value judgements, emotion, and own-knowledge

All language games we are part of are an expression of our values, we value different things and interact with the game differently then. e.g. disagree with the game, change the game, agree, etc.

1. Lebensform: literally meaning "form of life", but meaning the context in which a piece of language was used.
2. Language Game: something we participate in, and within which language gains meaning.

e.g. chess--a bishop can only move diagonally
1. not an objective fact
2. not justified
3. generally accepted and unquestioned
