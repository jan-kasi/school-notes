# 01 Intro
1958- Things Fall Apart

1962 - important year in history of modern African Countries, end of explicit colonialism, gaining independence from collapse of British Empire

Achebe doesn't wash away the disturbing things or sentimentalise the native African culture
- shows the moral complexity of situations and people, not just good and bad people

Things fall apart: set in 1890s, the first forays of the British into Nigeria and creeping colonialism
Arrow of God: set in 1920s, British colonial rule has been firmly established
No longer at ease: modern day Nigeria set in post-liberation stage, corruption 

How can you use the colonial language to express the anti-colonialist and African perspective.
- Linguistic colonialism

The history of Africa taught as being a blank and then filled in by British colonialists, where there were really full civilisations and histories which are destroyed. Not something which was "discovered".

The question of human nature


# 02 Style
- Changes in style between narrative focus on the Igbo people and the colonisers
- Clearly paragraphed
- Lots of proverbs and stories, sayings etc. from the area
- A lot of naming—places, objects, people
- Ongoing impact of the past and tradition on the community (use of tenses)
- Varied but natural use of tenses and structure, building sense of interlinking narrative and multi-layered areas to novel—ongoing impacts of past and present and the many stories involved in the current one
- Abrupt changes in perspective and time

- Narrator omniscient but telling the narrative as the characters see it too, information fed to reader through the biases of multiple people unfiltered by a narrative bias: highlights everyone’s flaws and avoid narrative bias towards a single person
- Does not default to a dichotomy of *x group* good and *y group* bad
  - Feels more like a true account
  - addresses structural problems
- Focalisation

- Use of foreign jargon emphasises the outsider perspective
- Constant misremembering and misquoting/misspeaking emphasises the fundamental misunderstandings and differences, and conflict between the two currently incompatible cultures
- Contrast between what the Igbo experience and what the colonisers see

- Language games, as it were

- Themes of "transliterated"-ish Igbo?

# Extracts
## p162
"his natives"
--> possessive pronoun 
--> amorphous collective
--> attitude of superiority
--> the people as an extension of himself
--> to Clake, it is meant well and benevolently
--> patronising (but not purposefully)
--> paternalistic

Keeps Ezeulu locked for four days and breaks the messenger's promise, goes on to criticise the "thoughtless acts of men like Wade"



"Following Captain Winterbottom's instruction...preparing himself to take on the burden of the administration"
- Contradiction of following his orders but also prepared to make them himself
- "Captain"

"taught to be polite" --> infantilising
"came upon a sacrifice by the roadside", not 'found' or 'saw' a sacrifice. connotation of aggression
"the other objects were normal", but are seen by the Igbo people as also being very important, the colonisers forcing their value system to replace the original one
Seen as "'disgusting juju'" even though as a sacrifice it is meant to be something good
"show a monstrous lack of feeling" -- though he could be seen the same way
"This incident worried Clarke a great deal". "Incident" diminishes the severity; although he is appalled at desecrating the sacrifice, it is called an "incident" with connotations of an accident and anomaly. Same infantilising tone, common phrase within schools and similar institutions trying to pretend to address a problem but not actually.

Recognition that the apparent care-free attitude is not so good, and possibly worse than the more serious attitude Winterbottom takes. That to not take an active interest is worse than a pompous disposition or just as bad.

Silver coin -- colonial material, probably mined by the colonies but claimed to be the colonisers. Imagery of pocketing the silver.

Clarke sees himself as the good guy, but he is only "the good guy" within the colonialist framework
- The Winterbottoms come in and rule these poor colonised people terribly; I will go and colonise them kindly and properly!
