# Unseen Prose essay
## Challenges
- Making sure to write a *commentary* and not a summary
  - Easy to fall into the trap of narrating the story and describing the characters rather than commenting on the way it is told
- Analysis of technique, not events
  - Try to focus on linguistic and structural techniques instead of what happens
- Structure and sequence
  - Harder to see than in a poem
- A 'limited' view
  - 

## How to overcome these challenges?
- Be clear *what* is happening in the text and the implications this has
- Annotate!
- **Analyse**
- Structure your writing so that it covers technique and is actually a commentary

## Starting points for analysis

| **Narrative**                                                | **Linguistic**      | **Structural**               | **Contextual**                        |

| Writer and narratorâ€™s attitude (*how* these features are presented) | Diction             | Dialogue                     | Critical theory                       |
