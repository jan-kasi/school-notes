## Main Argument

> He argues, it is agreed, that truth and falsity result from the joint operation of understanding and will. He seems to say that judgments consist of an idea of understanding affirmed or denied by an act of will. When the will affirms that which understanding comprehends, the judgment is true; when it affirms or denies an idea not clearly understood, the judgment is false. (The possibility of hitting the truth by chance is a blind man's bluff that plays no role in the theory.) Error can be avoided by refraining from judging any but clear ideas.

It seems paradoxical for a rationalist to attribute will as a faculty of judgment or choice, this might introduce voluntarism into certitude and thus may render truth arbitrary.

The will accepts clear ideas when they are held by understanding, and error arises when the will isn't determined to do this and chooses between confused ideas. This creates an asymmetry: when one is correct, "believes truly", the will is passive to understanding; when one is incorrect, "believes falsely", the will chooses to affirm an idea (and understanding is confused/passive to this).
- This asymmetry allows for the theory of errors to be absolved of some common confusions.
- Descartes argues for a necessitarian theory of truth, complemented by a voluntarist theory of error
  - CDP are true, one is not able to chose what is true, what is true is indubitably true
  - Judgment of what one believes to be true/correspond to external reality is a choice by the will

It is one thing for something to be true, and another thing for it to be received as true.
- By one kind of mental act, ideas are known to be true
- By another, judgment, they are accepted as true

This distinction is contextualised with Descartes' Aristotelian and Scholastic background. A&S logical analysis distinguishes between a proposition P and its denial as "judgmental acts of understanding", i.e. P is accepted or denied as a judgement on the understanding of P, whereas P itself is simply P (T or F).

Descartes approaches the distinction as between a CDP and a prejudice, where the two are not logically symmetrical as he analyses methologically rather than logically by analysing how the mental processes apply to both.

In M6, Descartes attributes confused judgments with passions/emotions/desires, the will, and these are the sources of error.
All false judgments can be traced to their source as an error of the will. Reason and CDP are treated as an infallible faculty which it's possible to always avoid error with (see M.p47).

In *Meditations*, judgment is a free choice by the will. This analysis is such that Descartes may achieve a theodicy to disprove the possibility of the deceiver hypothesis where one is made to go wrong. The argument is strangely positioned and “mingled” due to the two aims and two methods of providing a metaphysical foundation for science and a theodicy for God due to the errors of humans, by a philosophical and theological method.

Descartes must attribute error as sin, such that it is human and not divine fault. This means that his theory of error must attribute it to the will, as sin is given as fault of the will. This is the reason why judgment as a choice of free will appears.

M4 relies on the supposition of M3,

> Everything is true which I perceive very clearly and distinctly.

Where certainty is characterised as a

> Clear and distinct perception of that which I affirm



Descartes attempt not to provide the nature of truth, as it has already been given as a CDP, but to provide an explanation of the nature of error which defends God.

In M3, Descartes anticipates M4 by claiming how error cannot be found in an idea “as it is considered soley in itself”, or in volitions/passions, such that it can only be found in judgment—the affirmation or denial that an idea corresponds to something existent in formal reality.

It then seems that M4 suppresses this distinction between a volition and judgment, but maintains that both are an action by the will affirming or denying. Descartes appears to confuse **belief** (assent/acceptance) with **predication** (affirming or denying), he stipulates two mental attitudes towards ideas:

1. Mere contemplation
2. Belief/assent

Yet it isn’t understood by this what one “believes” when assenting to the idea of a human or a chimera. It isn’t properly elaborated.

Descartes abstracts from the formal questions of what a true idea is, it is not a formal analysis, i.e. it is not a logical theory at all:

> It is a psychological, or, better, a methodological theory which replaces formal logic by the logic of ideas.



1. Understanding/Intellect simply holds ideas, clear or confused
2. The will affirms or denies them
3. Inviting the inference that CDP are recognised and accepted as true owing to a willful act

The possibility of error, given that **truth** (CDP) is unproblematic, must be answered. Thus Descartes provides that

1. The possibility of error is due to a tendency to judge by the will some unclear idea (the scope of the will)
2. Avoiding error is achieved by abstaining from judging “things whose truth is not apparent”

Truth of ideas can be known prior to judgment as CDP are true by the natural light, it follows that judgment plays no role in *knowledge* of truth. One can know a CDP as true prior to the judgment. One knows by indifference; one is incorrect as a willed action.



> If error can be avoided by assenting only to clear and distinct ideas, and if, as Descartes says, the ideas of revealed religion are obscure because they exceed the limits of understanding, then it is sinful to be religious

An indirect way to show that the resolve to achieve clarity and accept nothing but clear ideas is already implicitly a rejection of faith and authority?

The interpretation offered by the paper is that Descartes had one philosophy and its continuity pre-Meditations lies beneath the scholastic surface (which it uses as a “Trojan horse”)

> The division of thought into the modes of understanding and will is based upon the cardinal premise that perceptions as such contain no error, and that error stems from faulty treatment of perceptions. Thus Descartes remarks that his perceptions of sensed objects are sufficiently clear and distinct taken by themselves; but he has a habit of judging that there are objects outside himself similar to his sense impressions, although he has never perceived such a relationship. This extension of judgment beyond understanding involves more than bare assent; it adds positive content to the perception, or "mingles," as the Sixth Meditation has it, an unperceived content with a perception. Error is accordingly characterized as a faulty attempt to make good "a lack of some knowledge which it seems I ought to possess" (AT VII, 55). Error arises from a refusal to be content with clear ideas as the sole criterion of truth. The refusal stems from two distinct sources-the practical needs of life, which engender natural prejudice, and a tendency to prefer "lofty and obscure" metaphysical and religious reasons to the simple clarity of mathematics (AT X, 371-72, 405; DM 8, 30). A "critique of reason," one may say, is already implicit in the restriction of truth to clear and distinct ideas.



Links to Stoic thought:

1. Judgment (*judicio*) is the fundamental act of sentience(“thinking”), and so contitutes the ground on which philosophy is built
2. *Judicio* consists of
   1. Perception or conception (*visum = phantasia*), and
   2. Assent/acceptance (*adsensio*)

3. Perceptions are adventitious, the one thing we can will to or not to is assent to the perceptions.
4. Philosophy then consists of dealing with perceptions to achieve firm and constant judgments which can’t be overthrown by contrary evidence or inconstancy of  passions.

5. Perceptions can be distinguished by being unstable and inconstant, or strictly understood (*katalepton*)
6. The understood are recognised by their clarity (*declaratio*)
7. These give rise to a judgment called *synkatathesis*, a union of perception and acceptance such that the “mind necessarily assents to what it clearly perceives”.
8. Assent is attributed to our will because it is within our power.

The apparent inconsistency that accepting clear ideas is necessary but acceptance is within our power is duplicated by Descartes. The mind must accept the CDP, knowing it true prior to judgment, but the will may try to resist this by passions.
