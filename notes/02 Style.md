# 02 Style
- Changes in style between narrative focus on the Igbo people and the colonisers
- Clearly paragraphed
- Lots of proverbs and stories, sayings etc. from the area
- A lot of naming—places, objects, people
- Ongoing impact of the past and tradition on the community (use of tenses)
- Varied but natural use of tenses and structure, building sense of interlinking narrative and multi-layered areas to novel—ongoing impacts of past and present and the many stories involved in the current one
- Abrupt changes in perspective and time

- Narrator omniscient but telling the narrative as the characters see it too, information fed to reader through the biases of multiple people unfiltered by a narrative bias: highlights everyone’s flaws and avoid narrative bias towards a single person
- Does not default to a dichotomy of *x group* good and *y group* bad
  - Feels more like a true account
  - addresses structural problems
- Focalisation

- Use of foreign jargon emphasises the outsider perspective
- Constant misremembering and misquoting/misspeaking emphasises the fundamental misunderstandings and differences, and conflict between the two currently incompatible cultures
- Contrast between what the Igbo experience and what the colonisers see

- Language games, as it were

- Transliterated Igbo?
