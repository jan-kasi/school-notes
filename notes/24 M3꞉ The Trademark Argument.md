# 24 M3: The Trademark Argument
Will: God given ability to chose/have a free will
Natural Light: turn of phrase for when you just know something as obviously true
CDP: very clearly true, indubitable.

Descartes turns to consider whether he can establish the existence of things beyond him. At this point, he does not necessarily believe in a 'real' physical external reality (Formal Reality), he is merely examining the ideas of it in his head (Representational Reality).

Three types of ideas:
1. OF The infinite substance (SINGULAR): "contains" everything. [innate]
2. OF Finite substances (PLURAL): "contain" the modes/accidents. Example: Fire [factitious/adventitious]
3. OF **Modes/accidents (properties)**. Example: heat [factitious/adventitious]

Venn diagram:
modes C finite substance C the infinite substance (God)

p33:
> Now it is manifest by the natural light that there must be *at least* as much reality in the efficient cause and total cause as in the effect of that cause

Aristotelian causes
Efficient cause: causation/what makes it
Total cause: the final cause

Levels of reality:
1 can cause 2. 1 can cause 3. 2 can cause 3.

Dotted line between 2 and 3, 3 is rep. 2 and 1 are formal.

1 is Fully Actualised (actuality). Top.
2 has both actuality and potentiality. Has extension (Primary Quality). In formal reality.
3 has less actuality (properties only have a small amount of actuality because they are in Representational reality)

"Flow of reality" goes down from 1 to 3.

If we have the idea of finite substance, this must have been caused by something at least as real as the finite substance. Descartes has lots of ideas of substances, these can come from him.

Descartes however has an idea of something infinite--God.

This idea cannot come from him - the idea of an infinite cannot come from a finite thing, it must come from an infinite thing. God.

God exists, and was the infinite being who plants the idea of the infinite inside his mind from birth. It is God signing creation with a trademark.

But can you have an idea of the infinite as simply the opposite of the finite (which can come from the finite)?
You must accept the levels of reality.
You must accept you have an idea of the infinite.
