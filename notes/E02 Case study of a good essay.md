# E02 Case study of a good essay
## E02: To what extent does suffering disprove the existence of God
---by me
22/25

## Why the intro is good
1. Identifies issue
2. Explains it
3. Brief summary of what will be argued WITH the position
4. Smol

- QA: issue & intent of the question
- Position: linked to Q, sets up structure and flow of essay (foreshadows, doesn't argue, 3 lines of inquiry and arguments of essay)

- In favour of BECAUSE ...
- Concise

## Body of the essay
### 1st line of inquiry
- Identifies problem of language/knowledge with belief rejected
- This is to be able to justify the rejection of the belief as basis for the rest.
- Discoursive

## Lines of Inquiry
What things do I need to examine to take a justified view on the whole question?
Claim
- Relevant to the question (inconsistent triad)
- CLEAR relevance
Discoursive:
- Better analysis 
Scholarship use
- SELECTION of it and the integrated use
- Links to detail, but don't vomit them
Judgement
- Evaluative

## Conclusion
Judgements at end of every line --> All judgements brought together
NOT A SUMMARY
Fully substantiating why your position is correct
 
## Other possible lines of inquiry
- Evil doesn't exist (Augustinian)
- Divine simplicity
- Necessity of Evil (Leibniz, Weil, Iraneas, Hick)
- Benevolence and Potency of God
- Teleology/telos of evil --> bring in lots of things

- Omniscience --- hard to make it relevant, however

**LINK MULTIPLE AREAS, not just the one it appears to be about. It is Philosophy of religion (One thing), not Nature of God, Arguments for God, Experience of God, etc. (multiple disconnected things)...**


## Could also start with:
- The evidential problem of evil (/suffering)
