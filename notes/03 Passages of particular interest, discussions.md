# 03 Passages of particular interest, discussions
## 1
### 63: "Noboru...quickly as possible":
tatami & honhe (spelling wrong), true face and mask
culture
new and old japan, westernising influence
unsure of the permanence of R relationship with F, and the position of N
Gender

R changed from wanting glory to falling to wanting something beautiful but becoming something wrong to attain it

### 51-2: "But Fusako was determined...her financially"
culture
new and old japan, westernising influence
Permanence of relationship

## 109-110 "Then Ryuji's...lunatic halo"
"coiled"
Presentation of Fusako
Ryuji initially hesitant and not wanting to do much
Ryuji kept in the dark and only later being told

Symbolism of Ryuji closing the peephole in the morning, cultural analysis or gender

The American Forces probably made the hole---implications for present ideas

***Focalisation***--shifting between character perspectives, when in Fusako it is mostly physicality and not meditated thoughts, when in Noboru it is thoughts:
- gender
- emphasis on her anger and shame

Classic authoritarian view of punishment, a "hang 'em and flog 'em parade".
Discipline and punishment of those who 'deserve it' and are are "filthy, disgusting thing[s]"

Mishima's view that Japan is becoming soft
- Family as a microcosm for society

Mishima's hatred of fathers because they reject the authority they 'should' have in society

Christian symbolism? The forgiving father.

Fusako (and the female characters) does not get the same depth of life and grand thoughts as the male characters
- views on gender
- Fusako is an object for Mishima (as the author), and for the characters
- Fusako is more successful and probably intelligent, but Mishima is not interested in this part of the characterisation *he* writes into the story, he is only interested in portraying his right-wing, social, and male perspective of the female and female sexuality
- Even though he implements Fusako's success into the story, she is objectified and not given the rich inner life that even some of the minor 13 year old characters
- Fusako and the actress given no grand ideas or rich life, only a 
  - even her name is underwhelming compared to the other characters, the characters refer to a ball of tough tussled yarn, other character's name's characters mean things such as two dragons
- Objectification of women
- Noboru granted absolute power by objectification of Fusako through the peephole

Eros and Thanatos
- present in every character (except the women, really)
- present in the narrative voice
- present in the authorial voice
- present in Mishima's life
