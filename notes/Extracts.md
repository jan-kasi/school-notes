# Extracts
## p162
"his natives"
--> possessive pronoun 
--> amorphous collective
--> attitude of superiority
--> the people as an extension of himself
--> to Clake, it is meant well and benevolently
--> patronising (but not purposefully)
--> paternalistic

Keeps Ezeulu locked for four days and breaks the messenger's promise, goes on to criticise the "thoughtless acts of men like Wade"



"Following Captain Winterbottom's instruction...preparing himself to take on the burden of the administration"
- Contradiction of following his orders but also prepared to make them himself
- "Captain"

"taught to be polite" --> infantilising
"came upon a sacrifice by the roadside", not 'found' or 'saw' a sacrifice. connotation of aggression
"the other objects were normal", but are seen by the Igbo people as also being very important, the colonisers forcing their value system to replace the original one
Seen as "'disgusting juju'" even though as a sacrifice it is meant to be something good
"show a monstrous lack of feeling" -- though he could be seen the same way
"This incident worried Clarke a great deal". "Incident" diminishes the severity; although he is appalled at desecrating the sacrifice, it is called an "incident" with connotations of an accident and anomaly. Same infantilising tone, common phrase within schools and similar institutions trying to pretend to address a problem but not actually.

Recognition that the apparent care-free attitude is not so good, and possibly worse than the more serious attitude Winterbottom takes. That to not take an active interest is worse than a pompous disposition or just as bad.

Silver coin -- colonial material, probably mined by the colonies but claimed to be the colonisers. Imagery of pocketing the silver.

Clarke sees himself as the good guy, but he is only "the good guy" within the colonialist framework
- The Winterbottoms come in and rule these poor colonised people terribly; I will go and colonise them kindly and properly!
