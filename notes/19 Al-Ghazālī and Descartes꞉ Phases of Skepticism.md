# 19 Al-Ghazālī and Descartes: Phases of Skepticism

https://www.jstor.org/stable/40213554

## Main argument

Al-Ghazālī’s *Deliverance from error* shares a striking similarity in structure and content to Descartes’ discussion in the First Meditation. The paper will analyse the skeptical periods of their works and the process they use to deal with the problem of doubt, bringing to light some subtle differences of the epistemological platform they arrive at.

It is possible that Descartes read Al-Ghazālī.

The skeptical method used by Descartes and Al-Ghazālī share similarities but also have important distinctions: Descartes uses the dream argument to establish he cannot know reality from dreams, Al-Ghazālī to establish



## Al-Ghazālī’s argument

1. To seek knowledge of the true meaning of things, it is necessary to inquire what the true meaning of knowledge is.
2. *Sure and certain* knowledge of something is when the thing “is made so manifest that no doubt clings to it, nor is it accompanied by the possibility of error and deception, nor can the mind even suppose such a possibility”
   -  Manifestation is: clearly apparent to understanding
   - This means that there can be relative levels of manifestation in that a thing can be manifest to one person and not another, or manifest in different degrees within the same or different people.
   - Sure and certain knowledge, then, is knowledge so clear that “the mind cannot suppose” the possibility of another degree of manifestation of the thing. In relation to this degree of manifestation, the former degree would be a concealment of it.
3. From this definition, Al-Ghazālī finds those beliefs which do not fit the criteria of not being able to suppose a higher degree of manifestation, and comes to “the point where my soul would not allow me to admit safely from error even in the case of my sense-data” 
   - Al-Ghazālī describes seeing a star as small and then realising with geometric proof that it is bigger than the world, the judgement of reason “giving the lie” to the senses by doing this, and thus calling all sense-data into doubt by this possibility.
   - Reason does this by actually *increasing* the extent the object is manifest, instead of “shrouding it in perpetual concealment, as Descartes’ dream hypothesis does with external reality.”
4. Al-Ghazālī posits that perhaps, then, he can only rely on this rational data (in both D and A, reason initially survives the dream hypothesis)
5. However, there is no assurance that the reliance on rational data is not like the former reliance on sense-data, in which one previously had confidence.
   - Had it not been for the reason-judge, he would still believe in the sense-data. Therefore it could be the case that there is a judge beyond reason, which if it were revealed would give the lie to judgements of reason just as reason gave the lie to judgements of sense.
   - The mere fact of the non-appearance of this further perception doesn’t prove its existence is impossible
6. When one is asleep they believe things to be fixed and lasting but upon waking find that these imaginings and beliefs were “groundless and unsubstantial.” While everything you believe with sense and reason might be true in relation to that state, you have no assurance you will suddenly experience a state of the same relation as the waking state has to the sleeping state; and your waking state would be dreaming in relation to the new, further state. “If you find yourself in such a state, you would be sure that all your rational beliefs were unsubstantial fancies.”
   - Al-Ghazālī doesn’t question whether he can know if he is dreaming or not, the third state and waking is described *by analogy* to that between waking and dreaming; it is only in relation to the former that the beliefs of the latter are groundless and unsubstantial.
   - This depends on actually understanding a difference between the two. This difference is of being “fixed and lasting” or “groundless and unsubstantial”, not true or false in referring to an absolute truth in relation to beliefs in all possible states. What is believed to be true might be true in relation to that state, but not in the third state where one sees they were not fixed and lasting
7. There may be even subsequent states to the third, but the position that all beliefs are absolutely mistaken needs a reference to some absolute truth to which beliefs in all possible states are false. In this case, the possibility of absolute knowledge is a state in which the objects are absolutely grounded and substantial.
8. Existing “with” a thing doesn’t mean it exists “by” that thing.
   - That clear, open eyes and coloured object *bring about* seeing colours is corrected by experiencing night. Seeing colours “with” the clearing of eyes is corrected from its happening “by” it. Further, the inference is that the disappearance and reappearance of colours with movement of the sun means it is likewise no *proof* that one sees colours “by” the sun.
   - The experience leading to the conclusion that the sun is the agent of seeing is mistaken, but *does* correct the previous false judgement of the agent being cleared eyes. While each judgement in the series is mistaken, they are not absolutely void of truth. So we can say that a judgement is true in relation to one state and false in relation to another.
9. Each new experience augments the understanding of the relation. The manifestation at each level of awareness is both the veil covering the manifestation beyond it and an effect of it providing clues to its discovery; it manifests itself in its concealment.
10. This raises the question if the object as it appears to reason is the ground, substance, and agent or another veil it is concealed by. It further raises the question of how the previous could be answered, as this would require some proof which can only be put together with primary cognitions which, in Al-Ghazālī’s case, he recognises as inadmissible.

## Relevance to Descartes as argued by paper

1. If dreaming and waking are truly indiscernible, then I could never truly know that I have woken from a dream, or ever have dreamed, so that I should not be able to recall having been deceived through dreams, as Descartes does.
2. Indeed, if dreaming really was indiscernible from wake, I should have as much reason to believe I am dreaming both times or am awake both times, and the idea of the difference between the two—one real and one unreal—could not have been derived from past discovery, “upon waking up”, that I had been dreaming.
3. Descartes, however, concludes there is no way to discern dreaming from waking experience, immediately after referring to previous experiences of waking up to realise the previous beliefs were false and reality was really a dream. This experience does not seem possible if the two states are indiscernible.
4. Descartes is searching for something guaranteeing accurate representation, consisting of sensible ideas, of an external world “from which those ideas proceeded and which those ideas completely resembled.” When waking, one does not find such a guarantee, but this means dream and wake are indiscernible only on the presupposition that the difference between the two states is *simply* that one set of ideas resembles the external world while the other doesn’t.
5. Therefore, an experience gives us no reason to believe we have ever even had a dream, or the real difference between dreams and wake don’t lie in the resemblance or lack of between internal ideas and external objets.

Al-Ghazālī’s presuppositions are discussed in 1.2:6.

Descartes’ cogito can be challenged with Al-Ghazālī’s pointing out that primary cognitions cannot be appealed to when reason itself is in question.

Al-Ghazālī’s method of skepticism is built on the possibility that deeper forms of knowledge might reveal the limitations and falsehoods of the current; Descartes’ is the possibility of a state of affairs such that there is no possibility to know anything, making all knowledge false and misleading.

If realising some belief was false means discovering some truth about how things actually stand (Dt $\rightarrow$Rf ?), then the fact we have never known a truth means we have never discovered that a belief was false ($\neg$Dt$\rightarrow$$\neg$Rf ?). So referencing the fact of previous mistakes/deceptions is an argument with no definite answer, as far as we know there is no such fact.

With Al-Ghazālī, it can further be questioned that perhaps it was reason which was wrong and there is a further state which will give the lie to reason.

## Key quotes

> Then sense data spoke up: "What assurance have you that your reliance on rational data is not like your reliance on sense-data? Indeed, you used to have confidence in me. Then the reason-judge came along and gave me the lie. But were it not for the reason-judge, you would still accept me as true. So there may be, beyond the perception of reason, another judge. And if the latter revealed itself, it would give the lie to the judgements of reason, just as the reason-judge revealed itself and gave the lie to the judgements of sense. The mere fact of the non-appearance of that further perception does not prove the impossibility of its existence (Al-Ghazālī, *Deliverance from Error*, p.56).

> Don't you see that when you are asleep you believe in certain things and imagine certain circumstances and believe they are fixed and lasting and entertain no doubts about that being their status? Then you wake up and know that all your imaginings and beliefs were groundless and unsubstantial. So while everything you believe through sensation or intellection in your waking state may be true in relation to that state, what assurance have you that you may not suddenly experience a state which would have the same relation to your waking state as the latter has to your dreaming, and your waking state would be dreaming in relation to that new and further state? If you found yourself in such a state, you would be sure that all your rational beliefs were unsubstantial fancies (Ibid, p.57).



> If they are, in fact, indiscernible, then I certainly cannot know that I have ever woken from a dream, or even that I have ever dreamed, and I should not be able, as Descartes is, to "recall having been deceived on other occasions even by similar thoughts in my dreams!" (Moad, 2009)

## Appraisal of paper

I agree generously with the comparison drawn between Al-Ghazālī and Descartes, finding the similarities plentiful and the subtle differences indeed significant. The difficulty for Descartes in being able to distinguish dreams and reality while claiming they are indiscernible might be challenged with the claim that Descartes doesn’t propose they are indiscernible when viewed as separate states, but indiscernible when within them. Such that it is not possible to tell one is dreaming until one is awake, similarly to how one might be convinced in the manifestation of a thing being ultimate before a higher judge corrects it or we are awoken to a higher state we are as yet unaware of. The premiss is not that “dreams and waking reality are indiscernible”, but that “The experience of dreaming does not tell me I am dreaming”: it can be the case that when one wakes, and is able to compare dream to waking experience, there may be apparent differences, but when there is no reference to that one was asleep there is no possibility for this comparison. Further, then, when one wakes there is no future reference from which to judge that one is *not* currently dreaming, and comparing a dream to another dream. I cannot know that I am dreaming or not as I cannot compare and even the past then be flawed as in dreams, so that I do not know of comparison to begin with. However, while I cannot tell if there is a dream or waking experience, the cogito can be formulated. Further, on the objection that there is a hidden premiss of non-contradiction and logic in the cogito—which can then be challenged with Al-Ghazālī—one can object that this is a misunderstanding of the nature of the cogito as being a logical necessity, where it is a self-verifying thought [insert words about this here]. A better objection might be that there is a possibility of a higher judge which can bring to light the falsehoods of the cogito and give the lie to reason and the cogito. However, this is an application of Al-Ghazālī’s epistemology and method of skepticism to Descartes’, requiring an entirely different discussion on which method of doubt is more appropriate: does doubt arise from the possibility there is a higher, deeper, truth and state from which the previous seems groundless; or because there is a possibility all knowledge may be absolutely false?

## Using the paper to counter the Meditations

In analysing Descartes’ method of doubt, one can invoke Al-Ghazālī as a criticism of the process of bringing doubt by the possibility of being absolutely mistaken due to a falsity, instead suggesting doubt is because of the possibility of a higher manifestation of knowledge, such that while the previous could be mistaken, it could also be correct but simply incomplete. Further, with the discussion of states, it is possible to challenge Descartes’ use of reason and the cogito—not by showing it to be false, but showing the possibility that a new judge might come or a higher state *from which* it is groundless: while it may be true on the state Descartes’ is on, there exists the possibility of a higher state from which it is not fixed, something Descartes has perhaps not addressed.
