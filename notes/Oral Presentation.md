## Part I of *The Vegetarian*

### Question:

#### To what extent does Yeong-hye's attempted suicide criticise Korean society and the family unit?

## 2

Taking a Confucian perspective, relationships between people are unequal with defined hierarchical roles. When this natural inequality is respected, it becomes easier to maintain stable relations among individuals and, therefore, in the society as a whole.



Still important in social, familial, and professional environments.

Influence is no longer as extensive in younger generations, as described by an article on South Korean culture by cultural atlas (https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/south-korean-culture/south-korean-culture-core-concepts), it still plays a large part in the overall actions of the family as a unit in society and the interactions within it.



In the first part of “The Vegetarian”, this hierarchical structure is evident in Yeong-hye and Mr Cheong’s relationship and their family:

their relationship is based on Mr Cheong’s illusion of mutual respect and wife’s submission and conformity.

Yeong-hye is shown as passive, while Mr Cheong is more active



Yeong-hye’s vegetarianism is seen as a disobedience and overturning of this structure by Mr Cheong and her family.



Her vegetarianism would be seen as undermining Mr Cheong’s authority over his wife (so he makes excuses for her) and an insult to the executive director who is paying for the food which she doesn’t eat.

This is only made worse by her blurred makeup, poor dress combination (she is wearing trainers) and not wearing a bra---seen as inappropriate etiquette and not caring about her appearance or keeping face.



Yeong-hye is seen as unaware or not caring about this social structure when she is described as “staring baldly at my boss’ wife”, which “appalled everyone present” as a sign of defiance against the hierarchical structure which would have her be apologetic towards her superior. this is seen as so outrageous that Mr Cheong wanders it is possible she “hadn’t grasped the status” of who she is staring at. This might reflect not only her dissociative state of mind which is later explored when Mr Cheong rapes her, but also of the younger generations who do not care so much about the Confucian hierarchy or face from their superiors.



It is not the case that she is trying to be rude. her refusal to conform to the normative expectations of Korean society, is not a refusal to conform, it is just a personal choice. this choice is a deviation and nonconforming action, but it is not done for this reason. yet, the structure would have it be so as it is seen as an act of defiance, disturbing the interactions itself almost to self-preserve the structure.



this even suggests that the reason the interactions are more “stable” when accepting them is not because it is naturally so or a great system of social interaction, but rather that it is made so artificially by people who want the structure to be so.

The events leading up to the suicide of Yeong-hye can be seen as a criticism of the Korean family and tradition. The dreams which Yeong-hye has and her mental decline are ignored by everyone and her declining health seen not as an issue as long as Mr Cheong retains face or is able to be satisfied in his control.
​

Yeong-hye’s refusal to eat meat is seen as a direct defiance of Mr Cheong’s authority by himself and Yeong-hye’s family.

The hierarchical relationships are seen as unbalanced by Yeong-hye’s refusal to eat meat, her apparent agency is not respected by the others and seen not as a personal choice but as a reaction and defiance of Mr Cheong’s choices.



The lead-up and direction towards her attempted suicide in the family dinner is a vignette criticising the family unit of traditional Korean society and it’s modern progression. The father is a dominant, violent man who beats Yeong-hye in front of her husband and force-feeds her. The wife cries and appears to superficially care for her daughter’s health, but only does so so that she is presentable in public and for her husband. The brother and sister do nothing but superficially complain. The husband is eerily passive throughout, as if his intrusion would cost the family face and it is not his place to intervene.



The vignette highlights the highly fragile and violent nature of the tradition family’s remnants, that non-conformity is treated as a hostile, manipulative act, that nothing is actually done other than superficial complaints---perhaps such that one can say “Oh, but I was in disagreement with what was happening” or “Oh, but I did not stop it, it was for the best though it was unpleasant” depending on the circumstances.



There is a habit of passivity and impulsiveness, of coercion disguised as caring and a self-righteousness of knowing what is best.



Perhaps it is the case that it would have been better for Yeong-hye to continue eating meat, or to “draw up a proper, well-balanced meal plan” as In-hye demands. However, the cause of her apparent defiance is never addressed or questioned. No one wants to ask why she is doing this---and if they do Yeong-hye is not allowed to explain or they do not want a reason. They only care about her superficial and apparent health, not her well-being.



This is a broader criticism on the reliance on face that the traditional family-unit has and craves in society. Yeong-hye’s appearance and actions are shameful to the whole family on the broader social scale, so anything must be done to prevent this occurring.

The attempted suicide itself is not seen as a response to the force feeding and trauma of Yeong-hye, as a response to the build-up of her conditions and experiences. It is not seen as the result of mental illness or instability either. It is seen as a further act of defiance by her family.



This further criticises the society of face, the blame is not on the family but on Yeong-hye’s personal responsibility.



The family structure cannot bear to admit any fault, because the system is supposed to be harmonious. Obviously, this is why everything went wrong: Yeong-hye’s defiance and usurping of the hierarchy led to the unstable relationships and family structure, made even worse by her actions. If only she had done as she was told, nothing would have happened.



Of course, this is absurd. It was not a disturbance of the harmonious structure which led to Yeong-hye attempting suicide. It was the reaction of the people within this structure. The reluctance to progress or accept Yeong-hye’s choices or to actually care about her health and well-being, instead focusing on preserving the family’s face because the Confucian family unit must maintain it, leads to the ridiculous actions by her family.



The structure must be seen as working, therefore it is artificially made to work by people within it. The toxicity of the traditional social values and carried on structure makes it so that individuals and units must conform and not lose face.

Even Yeong-ho’s wife admits that her father-in-law “went too far” to beat Yeong-hye, *in front of her husband. This criticism is not of the beating, it is about how it was public.

Everyone at the scene lost face because they were present or vicariously experiencing the others’ loss of face.



Mr Cheong decides to tell Yeong-hye it is better to consider the whole series of events as just a “bad dream” and forget about them, moving on. The refusal to acknowledge anything is wrong and wish to keep everything behind closed doors reflects the toxic social pressure to not lose face. Mr Cheong also wants to move on quickly and allow himself to be absolved of any blame by pretending none of this ever happened.



In-hye blames Yeong-hye because she doesn’t say anything to her father, which “was bound to make him upset”. The use of the word “upset” undermines his violence and excuses his actions almost as that of an angry toddler or someone who is sad and crying instead of the violence which the father expressed.



The continuing attempts to force Yeong-hye to eat meat reflects on the persistent attitude of the social structure and traditional hierarchy.



If we interpret Yeong-hye’s apathy to the social norms as the younger generation’s lack of care for face by their superiors in the Confucian ladder, then Yeong-hye’s attempted suicide is the response to the pressure by their peers or the inability to continue doing so, and the aftermath is the wish to forget about the ugliness which takes place and keep it in private rather than the public.
