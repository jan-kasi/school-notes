# 35 M6 Cartesian Dualism
## Distinctions with mind and body
p67 paragraph beginning "The first observation I make...".

### 1 Divisibility
"the body is by its very nature always divisible, while the mind is utterly indivisible"

"I am unable to distinguish any parts within myself; I understand myself to something quite single and complete"

- Identity lies within the mind. One can cut away at the body, but not at the mind; one remains the same even if body changes, Descartes' argues.

"the whole mind seems to be united to the whole body"


### 2 Connection (/commonsense)
"the mind is not immediately affected by all parts of the body, but only by the brain, or perhaps just one small part of the brain"
Brain is a bridge to the mind (it was thought to be specifically the pineal gland as lots of nerves go through it and it is observably distinct)

### 3 Motion

"the nature of the body is such that whenever a part is moved by some other part which is some distance away, it can always be moved in the same fashion by any of the parts which lie in between, even if the more distant part does nothing."

additionally, pain in the foot is felt in the foot but 'processed' in the mind.

Medical background, nervous system and reflexes. A physical network which 'ends' at the pineal glans.

### Preservation
"it should be produce the one sensation which...is most especially and most frequently conductive to the preservation of the healthy man."
 
### ext
"a given motion in the brain must always produce the same sensation in the mind"

"any given movement occurring in the part of the brain that immediately affects the mind produces just one corresponding sensation"

## Leibniz
> It is quite clear from all this...that the nature of man as a combination of mind and body.

Leibniz's Law: Identity of Indiscernibles
If you have two things and they have all the same properties, then you only have one thing--the two things cannot be distinguished from one and other (discerned) therefore must be treated as one thing.

### Undermine Cartesian Dualism
1. Assuming the nature of the mind or **overstepping** (saying more than is actually proven). Limited perception.
  - e.g. Pineal Gland, saw 
2. Descartes has only observed the physical world, no direct observations of the immaterial (what he claims is mind)
  - e.g. Brain, Nervous System, Pineal Gland. No observation of mind, arguably never interacted with it.

Together: Descartes has only observed the physical and extrapolated to the immaterial, and claims about the mind are assumptions.
  - You claim there are two things, but you have only observed one thing.

(It is difficult to know what the mind is/what properties it has.)

## The Masked Man Fallacy

> You see a masked man at a ball and have no idea who it is.
> Someone tells you it is your father! However, you say,
> "I know who my father is and I do not know who the masked man is---therefore they have different properties and therefore are two different people."

The mind and body are two different properties: Mind immaterial & indivisible; Body material & divisible. Similar to the inverse of indiscernibles law;
