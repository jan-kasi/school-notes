# II ch 18-20
## 18, Lockwood's Narration
How has the atmosphere changed Wuthering Heights?​


What brings about this change?​

​
p307, what makes this moment particularly poignant?​

​
## 18, Nelly's Narration
How is Catherine’s life at Wuthering Heights similar to that of her mother?​
- Cathy becomes friends with Hareton who has been raised similarly as Heathcliff had
- Cathy emotionally manipulates others slightly
- Cathy dislikes WH but does not despise it completely as she did near the beginning

How does Hareton and Catherine’s relationship progress?​
- They go from hating each other to being friends and later Nelly hints at a "union" and "wedding-day", "it was easy enough to win Mrs Heathcliff's heart"

p314-5, are there any parallels to or contrasts with the relationship between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff?​
- Cathy and Hareton have a similarly complex relationship of hate and love
- Hareton and Heathcliff both think Catherine will be "ashamed of" them, and make efforts to better themselves to not be 

Structure: What contrast is created between the endings of Chapters 17 and 18?
- Both end with considering someone marrying Cathy
- 17 ends with Lockwood reflecting on a miserable house with a "dumb Hareton" and "grim" Heathcliff; 18 ends with Nelly reflecting on a more happy house with a more educated Hareton and no Heathcliff (unless one considers Hareton to be the Heathcliff which the character was unable to be)
- 17 ends with Lockwood considering leaving with Cathy, 18 with Cathy and Hareton staying and Lockwood having only arrived


## 19
Why does Brontë include the image of Catherine and Hareton digging up the gooseberry and currant plants?​


Why does Heathcliff describe Catherine’s “infernal eyes” and tell her  “don’t remind me of your existence again”?​


How does Catherine show defiance towards Heathcliff?​
​

Why does Hareton defend Heathcliff? What effect does this have in the reader and our sympathy for Heathcliff?​
​

p321-2, how are Catherine and Hareton presented in this section of the novel?​

## Heathcliff
Read Heathcliff’s speech in p. 323-5. What has changed about Heathcliff? What has he realised?​


Why does Heathcliff stop eating virtually entirely?​
​

Is Heathcliff demonised by being compared to the supernatural (p. 329-32)? Why/why not?​

## Ending, p335-7
What is significant about Heathcliff's death?​
​

Does Nelly feel sympathy for Heathcliff by the end of the novel?​
​

“He probably raised the phantoms from thinking.” Do you agree with this view? Could this sentence apply to any of the other characters?​


Will Catherine and Hareton be able to escape Wuthering Heights or are they condemned to repeat its mistakes?​
​

Do you agree with the boy or with Lockwood about Catherine and Heathcliff’s deaths?
