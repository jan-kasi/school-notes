# 09 Empiricism
## Criticisms of Meditation 1 – the method 

Is doubting reason self-defeating? 

Descartes’ painting analogy – it appears that Descartes preserves belief in shape/extension/sound etc. however this is then called into doubt by the evil demon – even the most basic truths might be wrong.  

Two concerns emerge: 

If the demon hypothesis can cast doubt on basic ideas, then should it not cast doubt on our capacity to make basic logical inferences?
- e.g. the inference that a supremely good god would not deceive us about mathematics. Surely this means we must doubt the operation of reason itself? Cartesian skepticism comes to a halt – transcendental arguments?

What if the evil demon’s deception is so good that it is indistinguishable from actual reality?
- Imagine a counterfeit £10 that cannot be identified as counterfeit.
- Is there any real sense in which something can meaningfully be called a ‘fake’ when it will do everything a real £10 note would do and is indistinguishable.
  - Discussion between metaphysics and ontology (?) --> is it meaningfully different because it *comes* from somewhere else/has a different origin but the same nature.  
- What if the same is true for reality? If Descartes’ demon can create the perfect illusion, then surely it is identical to what we call reality. Therefore the evil demon hypothesis is empty nonesense, or not a false reality at all. 
  - You can doubt doubt and you can also call the evil demon hypothesis empty.  
- You cannot access it (the difference between "real" and "fake" reality) – but does lack of access (ignorance of the reality) mean that it is not important?

### John Locke  

Rejects entirely the notion of innate knowledge in *An Essay On Human Understanding*
Innate knowledge is sometimes hidden/we have to search for it to "know" it.

Innate knowledge is either: 
- 1. Something we all consciously have
- 2. Something we all have the capacity to receive 

Both are nonsense for Locke:  

1. ‘no proposition can be said to be in the mind, which it never knew, which it never yet was conscious of’ 

2. ‘all the truths a man ever come to know, will, by this account, be every one of them, innate’ 

==> Innate ideas are either nothing or everything. Both are nonsense.

There are no innate ideas just knowledge based on sense perception. If you doubt sense perception, you doubt every piece of knowledge. Cartesian skepticism should therefore arrive at nothing…?  

#### Leibniz’s response: knowledge can exist as ‘a disposition, an aptitude, a preformation’ 

Phobia? 
Babies’ desire for breastfeeding?  

- Aptitude: isn't developed ex nihilio 
- Preformation to breathe? Walking? Partially reflexive nature.  
- Instinct is innate knowledge? 
- Knowing to breathe?  

- What characterises instincts? How do you define it in relation to knowledge?  
- What is knowledge?  

Peter Carruthers: (human knowledge and human nature) – in the late 20th century Carruthers links this to psychological development. ‘It might also be maintained that knowledge is innate in the sense of being innately determined to make its appearance at some stage in childhood’  

- Learning a language 

Jean Piaget: you become capable of abstract thinking at the age of 10  

- Cognitive faculties that will trigger at certain ages  

Hotly contested but:
- that there is a difference between the age groups  
- once you get to certain ages you understand certain things in different ways  

Is it knowledge to have the disposition to think in an abstract way?  

Is it an aptitude? Are aptitudes not knowledge?  

They are innate but not knowledge – knowledge the capacity to understand  

### David Hume
Attacked Cartesian skepticism in *Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding*: 

‘it recommends a universal doubt, not only of all our former opinions and principles, but also our very faculties; of whose verocity, say they, we must assure ourselves, by a chain of reasoning, deduced from some original principle which cannot possibly be fallacious or deceitful. But neither is there any such original principle, which has a prerogative above others, that are self-evident and convincing; or if there were, could we advance a step beyond it, but by the use of those very faculties of which we are supposed to be already diffident. The Cartesian doubt therefore, were it ever possible to be attained by any human creature (as it plainly is not) would be entirely incurable; and no reasoning could ever bring us to a state of assurance and conviction upon any subject’ 

He argues that if you accept the Cartesian doubt you cannot reach any conclusions. You will find no knowledge.   

If you doubt your very faculties how could you ever trust your induction and deduction.  

METHOD OF DOUBT; CAN HE FIND KNOWLEDGE – coherency and success of method.
