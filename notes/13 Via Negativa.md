# 13 Via Negativa

## Statements
"God is not evil" -> Rejecting the idea that God's essence contains evil
"God is good" -> Rejecting the idea that God's essence contains evil, God's essence doesn't *contain* goodness, but the statement doesn't say this.
In making a positive affirmation, it implicitly negates the opposite. The affirming statement is a reworded negation about God's essence.

"God is love" -> God's essence doesn't contain evil, and hate is not part of his essence.


This embraces Divine Simplicity, we can only speak of what God is not: because God's essence contains nothing.

## Maimonides
Distinguishes between
1. God's actions
  - affirmative/positive. Don't add to essence and applied equivocally and secondarily.
2. God's essence/attributes
  - negations. Applied secondarily.

For Aquinas, you want to be able to talk primarily about God. and affirmatively/positively.

For a language system to be meaningful, you must be able to talk primarily and secondarily.

Aquinas argues that you can never talk about God with equivocal approaches.



## Application to Flew's parable of the Gardener
Via negative: the negations of what *God is not* are meaningful statements, and is the very nature of religious language.
You falsify the positive satements to *get* the negative ones which describe God.
