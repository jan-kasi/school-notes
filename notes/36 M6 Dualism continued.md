# 36 M6 Dualism continued

## Scientific study/rejection of Cartesian Dualism
### Medical perspective
> A traditional working hypothesis in neuroscience holds that a complete account of brain function is possible, in principle, in strictly neurophysiological terms without invoking conscious or mental agents; the neural correlates of subjective experience are conceived to exert causal influence but not mental qualities per se.

> has been challenged ... in which consciousness is conceived to be emergent and causal. Psychophysical interaction is explained in terms of the emergence ... functionally derived, mental properties that interact by laws and principles different from, and not reducible to those of neurophysiology.

> Reciprocal upward and downward, interlevel determination of the mental and neural action is accounted for on these terms without violating the principles of scientific explanation and without reducing the qualities of inner experience to those of physiology.

i.e. It can be explained materially


> Reasons are advanced to show that our latest mind-brain model is fundamentally monistic and not only fails to support dualism, but serves to further discount fading prospects for finding dualist forms or domains of conscious experience ...

### 2016, Harvard
Found a brain stem which is the main source of stimulation for awareness, when it is damaged consciousness is lost.
For some people in comas, this nerve is not functioning.
The rosteral dorsolateral pontine tegmentom (RDPT).
Paper states that consciousness "originates" from this.


Descartes' claims the brain is the bridge to the mind, so if it is damaged and one loses consciousness then it is not a direct challenge to Descartes (could just replace pineal gland with RDPT).

Claims that consciousness ORIGINATES from this, not simply contained or linked.

### Churchman
Every time the brain is damaged, the mind is affected in some way. One can predict the effect on the mind based on the type of damage.
Target primates and see the effects.
Questions how the mind and body can be separate if they are causally linked  Links to Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia?

## Contemporary criticism
### PF Strawson
> You do not know what souls are unless you know how to tell one from an other and to tell one is the  the same again

Descartes hasn't made the distinction clear

If the mind is the origin of our being but depends on our body to be part of us, then the body must be in some way part of the self.

> Two bodies cannot take the same space.

No way to verify it.

We have no basis for what the self is or to verify it, it is a meaningless statement. There is no criteria or evidence offered for the mind and body to be separate and us to be mind; but there is evidence for it being the same and us being mind.

### Aristotelian (Charlton?)

When we refer to the mind, we are not referring to something distinct from the body.
Body = Mind
Aristotle describes the soul as the thing which animates, it turns potentiality into actuality and allows motion; it goes away when you die.

### Anthony Kenny
The mind is the capacity for the 

## Dennet

- Argues that Descartes' has proposed a homunculus in the Cartesian theatre, but that this implies something must be behind this, and behind that, and so on.


- Although it isn’t possible to see inside someone’s mind, it is possible to study experiences and compare them

- The mind can be defined by its capabilities, it is nothing more than a collection of processes and functions

- Unity of the mind is challenged, asking what the mind is as if it is a single thing, where in reality it can be a collection of things.


> Dennett rejects this dualist alternative on three grounds: first, that its version of mind‐to‐body causation is in conflict with what we know, or have good reason to believe, from the findings of physical science; second, that the very notion of dualistic psychophysical causation is incoherent; and third, that dualism puts the mind beyond the reach of scientific investigation.

There is a logical problem with creating a causality of what is being perceived.

What seems to be so vs what it is; and what seems to seem to be so, and what is seems to be.
