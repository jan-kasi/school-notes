# 04 Synopsis
## Epistemology
knowledge is that which can be measured (observed)
measurement is scientific knowledge

direct experience and induction are by observation

Is there any part not drawn from sense perception?

If this is so, then tabula rasa.

What is the difference between knowing something and having an ability to do that


## Aristotle
Aristotle was an Empiricist.
- We have no source of knowledge other than sense perception
- All knowledge is therefore a posteriori

For:
How can you talk of something which you cannot experience, if you talk of the non-experienced, you still perceive this feeling
You are embodied in the world, knowledge cannot pass from the world to you undisturbed, and if it comes from within then it comes from the experience of embodied embodiment.

Against:
How do we experience/process the sense perception. If there is some framework for this, then how do we know how to use this means of acquiring knowledge, is itself a form of non sense-perception knowledge.
Reason.
We experience something, but if we have no innate truth or experience, how can we stimulate these experiences?

The working of the mind:
something active happens in the mind, it is not simply to receive sense perception: it is also to use it for something.
- receipt or processing
- how autonomous is the processing? if the processing is not automatic, then you can't say you know something just because you receive it; you do something with it to know it

## Rationalism
Knowledge can be known without sense perception
For some, this is too vague

To be a rationalist you must accept one or more of these three theses:
- *The Intuition/Deduction Thesis*: some propositions in a particular subject area are knowable by being deduced from intuited propositions. DESCARTES accepts
- *The Innate Knowledge Thesis*: we have knowledge of some truths in a particular subject area as part of our rational nature.
- *The Innate Concept Thesis*: we have some of the concepts we employ in a particular subject area as part of our rational nature. DESCARTES accepts

## ideas many seem to intuit
"Killing is wrong"
"Helping is good"
"I'm thinking"
"Save the innocent"
-->"war is wrong" deduction
--> "charity is good" deduction
