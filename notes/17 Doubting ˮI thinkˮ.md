# 17 Doubting "I think"

If one day you experience sensation X but formed the belief "I am being Y-ed", we would say that you were mistaken and in fact were in X.

There is an inductive link when you say "I am thinking/I think", it is an inductive belief of sensations which you *call* thinking, it is characterising a series of sensations inductively called thinking. 
- If you have an induction and you are Descartes, then you can doubt it.
You are mistaken in thinking, and were in fact experiencing another sensation


Objection (for D):
You may be mistaken  in thinking that Y means you are thinking, but that does not mean you are not thinking.
1. You have sensation Y
2. You form the belief that you are thinking
3. In forming this belief, you are thinking
4. Therefore you can know that you are thinking

Counter-objection (against D):
However, it is a belief. Not a piece of certain knowledge. It is a logical (lucky) induction.
1. You are in a state such that you are constantly in sensation Z (generally makes you think that you are thinking)
2. But, you do not form the belief "I am thinking"
3. You then experience sensation Y
4. You form the belief that you are thinking because of experiencing Y

Can you really say that you know that you are thinking.

(counter counter) Objection (for D):
However, it does not matter that you know what thinking is or wrongly induct it.
