# The Vegetarian: Ending
homework task, firefly questions
## Imagery:
> What could In-hye's visions on p. 169 represent? Give reasons for your answer.

The power of nature over humanity: "lines of rain drill into YH's body like spears"
The reliance of human society on nature as a foundation: the cities and things representing society are "floating...on the roof of the forest"
The human idea of society and humans higher than nature as they are like "above" nature, yet reliant on it like "islands".
The insignificance of human achievement: "only fragments" of human society being "swept away somewhere" yet in a "heartless sea". Nature does not care for it.

## Language:
> What is the effect of the repeated questioning on p. 170?

A mimetic device to emulate IH's thoughts and replicate in the reader the disbelief and wonder in her. The repeated questioning quickly emits a sense of disbelief and almost sarcasm, yet its consistency retains in it genuine wonder.
The constant questioning by IH is a repeated theme across part 3. While it typically serves to illustrate IH's hamartia of over-responsibility and blame, in this instance it changes the tone: from one of worry about the questions having to exist at all and a solution to prevent more questions, to  one of wanting to answer the question themselves.

## Structure:
> What is the effect of Han Kang beginning so many paragraphs in the end of the book with the phrase, "Time passes." Explain two effects that you think this repetition has.

1. anaphoric repetition of  "Time passes" quickly becomes repetitive and slightly dull. This is mimetic of the dullness IH experiences in her life, everything begins to feel the same as if there is no reference of time as a metric absolute or topological relation, only as a passage of it. This further reflects her psychological state of dissociation similar to YH's in withdrawing into herself but maintaining the uniqueness and difference between the two sisters. Han therefore creates in the reader a sense of the state IH is in that everything fades into a single passage of amorphous time.

2. To establish a difference between narration, further distancing the characters and revealing an insight into their thought process. In part 1, Mr Cheong keeps the time metrically, showing his place in capitalistic society of ordered efficiency and value-assignment to everything from people to time itself, and his view of how things are relational to an ideal of absolute time; neither relational, unique, nor amorphous. In part 2, BIL keeps the time relational to other events, we do not have such an ordered sense as with Mr C, but there is a sense of artistic value in the individual moments and how they are all related to each other --not to an absolute ideal. This reveals BIL's attempted rejection of the episteme of thought towards social ordering through time: he does not view everything as value assigned to some material ideal, but rather relational and individual yet still material and assigned value this way. This shows the psychological and social failure of the BIL. In part 3, time is amorphous. This could be seen as almost the typical romanticism of insanity or madness, which IH appears to be going towards in her declining mental health, yet still managing somewhat to not completely enter such as YH has. This is characterised by her successful rejection of time as a marker for events, there is no time between events other than "time passes": it does not matter what has happened when, 
only that it has; even this is challenged. point 1 serves to further this point as a counterbalance to the possible romanticised version of poor mental health which could be drawn, we see that the balance IH strikes leaves her unfeeling and dramatically dissociated. This shows how it is not the utopian break from hegemony and capitalistic episteme but an apathy to life which leaves IH bad enough to later consider hanging herself without much outwards perceived distress properly processed. Therefore, this establishes a different in narration and perspective in thought process.

## Structure:
> In what ways is the force feeding of Yeong-hye (p. 173-6) reminiscent of earlier scenes in the novel? Give at least two examples and explain the significance of Han referring back to them now.

1. before, IH tries to feed YH fruits she previously wanted; before, mother tries to feed her meat she previously enjoyed. They also both try to tempt her by placing them in her hands, or near her lips or nose.

2. doctor uses a tranquiliser, feeding tube, and asks assistants to hold YH still;  father slaps YH's mouth open, uses fingers to force-feed her, and asks family members to hold her down.

3. Both times the force-feeders believe they are doing their "duty": to "preserve life" or social respect/health of their daughter.


This comparison links the reader's thoughts to the previous episode of force-feeding, which is intentionally described to be horrific and wrong. The second time, it is arguably more gruesome yet packaged as a medical procedure and so justified. Han challenges this through the comparison, to show how force-feeding is always distressing and, perhaps, wrong. Also to challenge the view that society knows what is best for the individual, both times they do not accept the new situation and cling on to the past (feeding meat because before YH ate meat, feeding fruit and then gruel because before she did). This social commentary therefore serves as a criticism of social power over the individual, and of the double standards held over authority and righteousness. The standardised treatment's failure such that this emergency procedure needed to take place compares to the previous failure of the family to support YH, drawing a parallel of how individual and social failure to support others leads to catastrophic disasters, regardless of how they are presented--as the individual's fault, or as inevitable.

## Themes:
> "It's your body, you can treat it however you please." (p. 177)
> To what extent do you see this philosophy supported in 'The Vegetarian'?

Highly so. Although the argument could be made that the physical state of YH--and perhaps mental state too--contradicts this, i find this to be incorrect.

Han criticises the failure of society as a whole and the individuals within it to adapt to and accommodate for individuality and bodily sovereignty. In every case, it is always the doctors or family presented as failing YH, not YH failing herself. On a whole, it is the society failing individuals in the entire novel which drives the plot and suffering within it. Both sisters are failed by society, and to an extent so are Mr C and the BIL.

However, the BIL and Mr C are not presented as complete victims of social failure. They chose to take advantage over other bodies, removing this autonomy over the self in doing so through YH's marital rape by Mr C and rape by BIL, as well as neglect of IH and the jealousy of both husbands for the other wife. Thry are presented as victims of society in some ways, but also aggressors.

Therefore, the idea that "your body, you can treat it however you please" is thoroughly supported throughout the novel. It is not that one should be refused sovereignty over the self and body to avoid the disasters of The Vegetarian, but that society and individuals respect and support this autonomy.

## Themes:
> "He is a sensitive child, prone to minor illnesses, but he is also a happy child. How will she make sure he stays this way?" (p. 179)
> Does 'The Vegetarian' provide an answer to this question?
> Think about who or what Ji-woo could represent and the significance of his own dream on p.180.
> Think too about if there is any way to avoid the fate of Yeong-hye and In-hye or if it is presented as inevitable.

The Vegetarian presents the fatal flaws of the characters as inevitable given the social structure, and caused by it.

The Vegetarian suggests that a continuation of the hierarchical and unmoving social structure will leave no true hope for Ji-woo's happiness. However, it suggests that on an individual level it is possible to retain happiness, or some version of it, despite the social standard. As evidenced by IH's almost salvation by the mere existence of Ji-woo and the responsibility she feels for him, The Vegetarian provides a solution. By individual change and connection it is possible to maintain a happy life, and perhaps in the process change the structures themselves. Although this salvation is really IH giving in to her hamartia of over responsibility, it serves also to save her. Therefore The Vegetarian presents that these flaws in characters and therefore individuals are only flaws by how they are handled by others and built in society.

Ji-woo therefore represents the future generation and the hopelessness hope of change, the change which occurs is the social structure repeating itself. Yet through this there is still the possibility for genuine change and happiness.
Character:
"I have dreams too...and I could let myself dissolve into them, let them take me over...but surely the dream isn't all there is? We have to wake up at some point, don't we?" (p. 182)
To what extent do you think this summarises the differences between the two sisters? Why?
YH has become lost inside her dreams away from reality, while IH has become lost in reality away from dreams. Yet in an oxymoronic way, YH is more in reality than IH.

YH has been able to make her reality be her dream, while IH fails to make reality real or her dreams false by her rejection of them, her inability to break free from social "bars" of the "jail" she finds herself in.

The apparent realism of IH, "we have to wake up at some point, don't we?", contrasts her dissociation and hopelessness in life. YH is able to stop eating meat and become more plant-like, though only in her mind, and IH is unable to stop her dreams or even act in the ways she wants to. This makes YH more real in a way than IH through YH's ability to self-determine.
