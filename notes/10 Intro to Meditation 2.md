# 10 Intro to Meditation 2

Recall the first 5 waves of doubt found within M1 and then work out why D states in M2 (p21) that "Does it now follow that I too do not exist?"
1. Sensory doubt
2. Dream Argument
3. Painter's Analogy
4. Deceiving God hypothesis : A worst case scenario, posed as a hypothetical extreme skepticism, so that the cogito is not dependent on belief in God
5. Defective origins hypothesis: For the atheist, less certainty because of chance. Chance is a defective origin.
4+5 -> find a truth that doesn't depend on God or no God
Why does he question his existence?
- The next stage of skepticism, with a different intention in mind
- Setting up the cogito
- Because if he can't know his own existence then that's it, there is nothing that can be known

## The Cogito
> I am, I exist

Logical
- Logical connection between existing and thinking
- The only thing that everyone does (until phenomenology says no, it is experiencing)
- The only thing left that can't be doubted

Implications if this is the only knowable thing (i.e. if it is accepted and also that further attempts at knowledge are impossible)
- the only thing you can know is that you alone exist as a singly held thought

But, do thoughts correlate to a thing? Rejection of thought and the being behind it as a necessary connection
Criticisms of the cogito may support criticisms of cartesian doubt.


Cottingham, cogito is not a piece of logic or a necessary connection, it is a different thing: a self verifying thought.
