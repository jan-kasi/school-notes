# 13 Doubting "Therefore"
Video

Issues of the *therefore*, reason why later reformulated by D to exclude the therefore

If I think[,] I must exist

For "I think therefore I am", you must have two other premises as it is a syllogism:
1. Whatever thinks, exists
2. I am thinking
3. Therefore I exist

With a therefore, it is a logical necessity
For Descartes, there is no link and no therefore as it is "a conceptual claim about the relation between thought and existence. So it is an assumption of an entirely different kind from the premise "I think"."


Modus Ponens
> P
> P -> Q
> therefore Q

If evil deceiver, then the "->" might be confused by the deceiver such that we always go wrong when it happens. Such as confusing us that 2+2=5 every time, it does not *actually* equal 5, we are simply made to think it does. So the ergo can be doubted.

> p, p implies q
