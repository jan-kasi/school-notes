# 15 Kant
Kant holds that
- you cannot know god through synthetic statements
  - you cannot know god at all

## Kant's criticism of the Ontological Argument
> "Existence is not a predicate"

- not a predicate, i.e. not a property of something
- it is not analytic to say "x exists"
  - existence is not contained within the subject
  - "God exists" =/= analytic.
    - Because "God does not exist" is not a contradiction

- If you add or remove the predicate of existence from the subject in statements, nothing changes in reality
  - you might be describing something wrong, but there is no necessary connection between, e.g., this file and existence
- Two things come from this:
  - Existence is never a *necessary* predicate of a concept
  - Saying something does not exist is not a contradiction


Underneath this is the distinction Kant makes a distinction between the Noumenal and the Phenomenal
  - noumenal is things as they are (reality)
  - phenomenal is things as we experience them (experienced)
We cannot know god in the noumenal. The line between the phenomenal and the noumenal is impenetrable
- This is the opposite of what Descartes says, he holds that there are gaps inside the barrier which gives us glimpses into the noumenal

It is a categorical error to claim existence and things like colours (predicates) are the same category. i.e. Existence is not in the set of predicates


1. "The chair is b+g"
2. "The existing chair is b+g"
3. "The non existing chair is b+g"


b+g is the predicate
"existing chair" and "non existing chair" are both the subject which b+g descibes

They are all saying the properties of the chair which doesn't change.
2 and 3 also attempt to describe the state of the chair in the noumenal (still not a property). This, to Kant, is impossible: we are trying to describe the noumenal, and as if a state is a property.




## Do Kant's criticisms actually do anything to the Ontological Argument?
Does Anselm really add existence to the concept of God?
"P1. god exists, P2. therefore god exists"

Perhaps not:
- Anselm adds existence on *contingently*
- Anselm is asserting that existence is necessary for God, it is as much a part of God as three-sidedness is part of a triangle; God's existence is him. It is not just a predicate, it is a necessary part of God's essence.

- This doesn't contradict unnknowability of God's essence, we just have imperfect glimpses of it through the phenomenal/experience.

## Further
Yet, this (the ontological argument)is not a persuasive argument. It simply affirms preexisting belief in God's existence

Furthermore, this deduces existence from nature; one should derive nature from existence. It is a circularity.
