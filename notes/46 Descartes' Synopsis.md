# 46 Descartes' Synopsis

- In Synopsis Descartes' claims to address **the Soul** in Med 2.
- Also that M6 is not so persuasive but that this proves how God can be more well known than other things
- Descartes establishes the Soul and then God.
- M1 and 4 are about why one can TRUST his rationalism.

[
The Soul (mind): M2; M6
God: M3; M5
] (CDP, Innate ideas) ] -> Knowledge: M1; M4 (why you can trust these conclusions)
--
==>  FAITH

Claims that this [] is for the non believers. States he wants to do is to bring them to theism.

For the theist, they will agree and conclude on something which they already believe. This is Aquinas' journey.
Aquinas holds that reason is required for faith.


Descartes' purports to write a "First Philosophy"; this is both a metaphysics and a reset for the canon of philosophy.
in which one can arrive at the knowledge of God with both rationalism (philosophy) or faith.

If Aquinas took Socrates to do this, and died in the enlightenment, Descartes' is doing the same thing and saying that the previous is no longer needed.
Aquinas' arguments are often empiricist (e.g. cosmological), Descartes' are rationalist (his cosmological argument is from ideas).
