# The Vegetarian: writing task

## pages 20—25

It seemed Mr Cheong had been rushing around trying to find the restaurant, given his state of breathlessness and inauthentic composure. The wife of Mr Cheong was oddly thin and her makeup blurred, I cannot bring to mind how one could bear to turn up in such a state.

The restaurant was luxurious, but rather boring after several times of dining. Hopefully Mr Cheong will not mind, though his constant gaze surveying the room as if one had never seen a restaurant other than the, frankly, dirty ones which litter the streets. Well, not dirty—definitely not clean.

Finally it seemed Mr Cheong had managed to fix himself from his rush and sat down. His sudden falter in voice caught almost everyone’s attention: face flushed, eyes wide, mouth still open and lacking sound which ought to have continued. It was immediately embarrassing to note what it was which had gotten Mr Cheong into such a vicariously shameful pose; the wife not only seemed to have mismatching shoes and clothes, hastily and badly applied makeup,  and a disturbingly vacant expression, but also to have forgotten—or more likely, not had the decency of etiquette—to wear a bra.

Mr Cheong looks past and notices my amused expression, staring at me in a most impolite manner. I make no effort to hide my curiosity at this quaint vignette, or my disappointment. To think one would turn up to a dinner party in such a state, allowing a wife to present herself in such a manner!

The wife of Mr Cheong’s boss attempted to save his face quite unsuccessfully though small talk. Having maintained his falsely casual attire for some while he more and more seemed to strain and appear even more inauthentic if that were possible. I cannot think of a worse situation to find oneself in.

“I won’t eat it.”

It seems the wife speaks after all. For a brief moment I had thought she might be mute; few people refuse to eat a meal at a dinner party, fewer yet do not talk at all to the others.

It is impossible to not be distracted by the state of the wife’s dressing. 

There were brief exchanges about diet and vegetarianism, risen out of the declaration that Mr Cheong’s wife does not eat meat. Some initial curiosity, some initial remarks. A rather interesting exchange of opinions, giving my own on how cutting out parts of a diet is narrow minded.

Perhaps Mr Cheong’s wife is odder than she lets on, 

“A balanced diet goes hand in hand with a balanced mind, don't you think?” I question the group.

Mr Cheong hastily explains that it is a diet to help with his wife’s gastroenteritis, which apparently has helped relieve her acute discomfort which even caused sleeping problems. Everyone nods in understanding; the wife is not vegetarian for some weak-minded feelings of repulsion. Though this explanation is unsatisfactory, it seems Mr Cheong has lost enough face for his discourtesy this evening already.

The party remained distanced from the two, with good reason, until the courses were all over. Not once did the wife touch anything with so much as a hint of meat, perhaps it is some sort of medical diet for her to be so careful; the effect on her appearance is not flattering, I must say. To be afflicted with such a condition I could not tolerate, though even less to be as narrow minded as to consider such a radical diet without reason; how closed a mind must be to reason to consider such a selfish attitude.

Mr Cheong’s boss’ wife continues trying to be friendly and polite, an admirable feet to break through the ice those two emit. She even goes so far as to show concern for the wife: she has barely eaten at all.

Oh, now it seems I was wrong about a more shameful situation. Oh, how rude. How bald! If there was no possibility of losing face Mr Cheong has lost it anyway. She is not even ashamed. Not embarrassed. Not apologetic. Not anything. She stares blankly at her husband’s boss’ wife. Blankly and for long. Unreasonably long, too long to even be dismissed afterwards or forgotten, does the picky wife stare at the conveyor of concern and friendly, flamboyant, sociable small talk and remarks, baldly and for far, far, too long.
