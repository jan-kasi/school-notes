# 31 M5 Miner Paper
"The Dependence of Descartes' Ontological Proof Upon the Doctrine of Causa Sui", R. C. Miner
In 1st responses, Descartes argues for God as causa sui, the cause of himself. Later clarified in 4th responses.

There is a connection between causa sui and Descartes' ontological argument.

> in replying to both Caterus and Arnauld, Descartes argues in such a way as to suggest that the ontological proof actually depends upon the notion of God as causa sui, and is scarcely intelligible without it

## 1. Caterus' Objections and the *Primae Responsiones*
Ideas, which only contain objective reality, do not need a cause; they are not "nothing" because they can be conceived but do not need a cause. This is also the case for eternal truths and God.
Using ideas to prove God fails as an idea does not need a cause.

> To support his objection, Caterus observes that, even if God is truly said to derive his existence from himself (a se), this does not prove his existence. The reason, Caterus says, is that in common usage "from itself simply means "not from another."

Finite things may derive their existence from themselves too, while still being finite. E.g. a hot thing qua being hot is hot from itself in that the heat doesn't come from another.

Descartes counters the argument that an idea doesn't need a cause and suggests it is acceptable to ask for a cause of an idea. Uses the opportunity of the accepted ambiguity of "from itself" to clarify by adding his doctrine of causa sui.
- Something which doesn't require anything else to begin or continue existing is in a sense it's own cause.
- God is such a being.

> This is not quite to say that God is the efficient cause of himself in the narrow sense of the term, since God is not prior to or distinct from himself.

## 2 Aurnauld's Objection to causa sui
> Arnauld characterizes the above Cartesian declaration as a "hard saying" which indeed is "false," since "it is a manifest contradiction that anything should derive its existence positively and as it were causally from itself." Every effect, as an effect depends upon a cause that is not itself. The notion of cause and effect must involve two terms, since it is a relation. To speak of efficient cause implies an existence-giving entity and an existence-receiving entity.

We cannot mean that God derives existence from himself "positively as if it were causally" as this is a relation in time between different bodies and God is infinite and contains the idea of infinite duration, temporal concepts cannot be applied. So it can only be meant in the negative sense "not from another".

Application of positive sense also means God preseves himself, but preservation is continuous creation and it "cannot be said that God creates himself". Also, "the very terms 'continuation' and 'preservation' imply some potentiality, whereas an infinite being is pure actuality, without any potentiality."

We only apply the efficient cause to existences, not to essences. Essence can only be explained by formal causality (referencing the nature of that thing). So the question "Why does God exist" can't be answered by an efficient or quasi-efficient cause, it must only be by the nature of God "because he is God". God needs no efficient cause.
> "he is an infinite being, whose existence is his essence. For the only things that require an efficient cause are those in which actual existence may be distinguished from existence."


Descartes replies that causa sui doesn't mean God is his own efficient cause, but a way to say that the reason why God doesn't need a cause is a positive reason. It's an affirmation of God's power.
In quasi-efficient causes, you can remove time while maintaining the causation and there is no distinction between cause and effect. Descartes thinks he can remove these 2 from efficient causality and retain the important part.
Agrees with Arnauld that the casue of nature cannot be external. The immense power of God means he can bestow existence upon himself, thus causa sui. God is not his efficient cause in the strict sense, but is in the quasi-efficient sense.

The identity of existence within essense implies the opposite of what Aurnauld believes.
> divine case implies the opposite. Since God may be regarded as pure existence, and since Arnauld concedes that the notion of efficient causality is relevant whenever we are considering the existence of something, we may legitimately ask about the efficient cause of God, regarded as pure existence. "In the case of God, essence is not distinct from existence; hence we can ask for the efficient cause.

### Causa sui and Ontological argument

> "It is quite evident that existence can no more be separated from the essence of God than the fact that its three angles equal two right angles can be separated from the essence of a triangle, or than the idea of a mountain can be separated from the idea of a valley. Hence it is just as much of a contradiction to think of God (that is, a supremely perfect being) lacking existence (that is lacking a perfection), as it is to think of a mountain without a valley.

An idea may contain existence within its essence but only potentially exist and not exist in formal reality. e.g. think that the idea of the supremely perfect body contains existence, all that follows is that the body is capable of existing but not that it exists in reality as existing only in the intellect and not in reality is not as perfect as existing in reality.

God at the very leas has possible existence, but is different because as causa sui his power is so immense that one recognises it must be able to exist by its own power and as it has possible exitence, it must necessarily exist. God derives existence positively.

The idea Dei contains necessary existence but the justification for attributing necessary existence is the naming of God as causa sui.
