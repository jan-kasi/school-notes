# Modernism

Born out of the post-war psyche of the First World War
- Loss of faith in humanity
- Loss of faith in society (increasing individualism)
- Loss of faith in the human mind (shell shock, PTSD)
- Loss of faith in religion
- Loss of faith in politics (leading to extremism)

Nearly everyone in Western Europe directly affected by the war or knew someone who did
Atmosphere of sadness, hopelessness and despair in Europe
Loss of faith in traditional institutions

Art

> Make it new!

Ezra Pound
> We are among the ruins.

D.H Lawrence, *Lady Chatterley's Lover*
> After such knowledge, what forgiveness?

T.S. Eliot, *Gerontion*
> All changed, changed utterly:
A terrible beauty is born

W.B. Yeats, *Easter 1916*

The literal style and form of art was seen to be inadequate post WW1. A new movement was born, Modernism.

Intellectual context in the modern age
- deadly effects of technology exposed by WW1. Some saw it as a gateway to the future, others as symptomatic of the soulless automation crushing humanity
- Political divides
- Beginning of the great ideological experiments, USSR/eq and Nazi Germany
- Experimentalism
  - medium=message
  - themes of alienation
  - allusion
  - stream of consciousness
  - contradiction


Medium = message
- Cannot easily be adapted from one form to another, as form and language are the point/plot

Allusion
- Lots of allusions in modernist works 
- Even Ezra Pound's famous slogan is, ironically, an allusion to the first king of the Shang dynasty's washbasin inscribed washbasin
- Why?
  - Emphasise modern alienation from earlier cultural institutions
  - How the past influences the present
  - Irony and bathos
  - Present fragmentary and ruined history/culture and the modern age clinging to or trying to make sense of them
- To compare the past to modernity, either favourably or unfavourably


Stream of consciousness
- Introduced by William James in *Principles of Psychology* (1890) used to mean a person's thoughts and conscious reactions to events, perceived as a continuous flow.
- Influenced by the psychoanalysts

- In literature, stream of consciousness is a literary style in which a character's thoughts, feelings, and reactions are depicted in a continuous glow interrupted by objective description or conventional dialogue. Joyce, Woolf and Proust most notable early exponents. Most extreme form of first person narrative and most opposite of unreliable narrator.

- Unity of time, place and action (literal level)
- "Uncontrollable" narrative
- No clear chronology, past, present and maybe future experienced together
- Disorder and fragmentation of thoughts
- Often syntactically irregular
- Characters are studied more as isolated individuals than as "types" or members of a group
- Focus is internal life of characters, medium=meaning


Modernism can be seen in some ways as contradictory, and understood as a collection of small, individual movements rather than one overall unified movement. However, all the groups share in some way the key ideology of modernism: breaking from the past, experimentalism and radicalism in both form and content.
- politics: newness in politics is different for different modernists
- the masses: desperate to engage the common man, yet heavy allusions almost inaccessible (some modernists say this inaccessibility is the point)
- realism: could be argued the stream of consciousness is more so a rejection & reaction to the realist 19th century fiction
- the past: rejecting the past but being haunted by it
