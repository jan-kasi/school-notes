# 04 Man as an Irrational Animal

Darwin
- we are not that different from other animals
- we were not always "human"
- common ancestor
- we may fundamentally be the same as humans 
- spark of consciousness was biological/ not given (?)
- not unique to us as humans, another animal could have the same

- we may be driven by urges from evolution
- just evolved animals


- change is driven by random mutations

- irrational animal --> where does reason come from?


Reason and emotions
- reason controlling emotions
- emotions controlling reason

"Two things fill my mind with awe and wonder, the moral law within and the starry sky above" ---kant


Reason as decision making or as objectivity or as a calculation of best outcomes


lesson:
ranking
1. preference to help out kin
3. cognitive bias
3. competitiveness and agression
4. mate selection 
^ those are all good tbh

5. male competitiveness and agression
6. morality --- depends on what you think it is ._.
   also that "altruism=irrational" moment from other students was kind of cringe...
