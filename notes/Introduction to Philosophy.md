# Introduction to Philosophy
MOOC by Edinburgh university
## Week 1
### L1: What is philosophy
(IB phil P3 links)
Philosophy as an activity
Fundamental in that a philosophical question and issue is never far away and can always be asked, even if not a very relevant or interesting one.
Not fundamental in that it is not necessary for everything
Fundamental in that it often deals with the underlying nature of something else, or provides a base foundation for it

### L2
Many arguments can be put into a format of various premises and a conclusion.
Arguments can be said to be valid/invalid and sound/unsound

Validity:
An argument is valid if the conclusion follows from the premises

Soundness:
An argument is sound if the argument is valid *and* the premises are true.

> in philosophy, often what we're doing is trying to work out the right way of thinking about things with the help of engaging with arguments and positions that...other philosophers have put forward.

> often in philosophy, what were thinking about and how were thinking about it is so complex that it's very very hard to try and boil down our thinking to straight forward series of premises and conclusions. But that doesn't mean that its not usually a good idea to try and do that, to try and make our thinking as clear and precise to ourselves as we possibly can.

Thinking of philosophy purely in terms of clearly stated premises and conclusions may lead to some things being lost.

Putman:
> Philosophy needs vision and argument...there is something disappointing about a philosophical work that contains arguments, however good, which are not inspired by some genuine vision, and something disappointing about a philosophical work that contains vision, however inspiring, which is unsupported by arguments...
> and I take that to mean vision as to how to live our lives, and how to order our societies

- An argument can be useful not by making us accept the conclusion, but by helping us focus on what it means when we say/think something relating to it
- One should do more than just try to asses the premises and conclusions, one should try to think about what the argument is driving at and if we can find a better way of reaching it or come to see what we agree and disagree with

#### How do we know if there is "a right way of thinking about things"?
How do we know that there is a right way to think about things in a given case?
How do we know the way to arrive at this?

Hume
- It is appropriate to hold a skeptical view of philosophy
- Philosophy should stay true to our experience of the world
- By doing philosophy we can discover the habits we have of associating impressions and ideas that we have to draw conclusions about the world from
- We can never really know whether those habits of association are the right ones

Kant
- After reading Hume, Kant realises that he had just "assumed" that philosophy could bring us to facts about how the world was, and that everyone before Hume had also done this
- So Kant tries to prove that philosophy can do this in his *Critique of Pure Reason*, by showing that the idea of a world which doesn't correspond to the rules governing our mind is nonsensical
