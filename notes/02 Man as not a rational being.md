# 02 Man as not a rational being
## Human nature

- Are we irrational beings?

10 examples of being irrational:

- phobias/irrational fears—make sure it has no advantageous bases
  - arachnophobia
  - xenophobia?
  - agarophobia
  - icthyophobia
  - triphobia
  - fear of long words
  - phobia of buttons
  - ANY phobia. Because it is so extreme, they may have a possible rational basis but the RESPONSE is not.
- optical illusions/mirages
- Vices—
- revenge/homicidal thoughts
- obsessions
- ocd
- compulsions
- irrational paranoia
  - Of being watched by everyone, conspiracy paranoia, everyone being replaced, etc.
- Fight/Flight response we *become* irrational
- Though this might go to a poopy "psychological egoism=good and rational" position:
  -  Putting your life on the line to save someone
  - Perhaps firefighters

- Fear of death/something inevitable?



## criticisms of reason being defining part of being human

- unconscious/vegetative state—still human (?)  —> therefore not part of being human if they still are human

- Emotions make us human (?)
  - Adolf Eichmann (deontology?)
  - Same criticism applies to this as to reason
  - Emotions *ARE* rational
