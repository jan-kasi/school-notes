# 42 Q: The star is not greater than the flame

a. Explain Descartes' claim that we are driven to believe that "the star is not greater than the flame".
b. Evaluate the extent to which the intellect has to distrust the senses.

## A
Things which appear one way to the senses, but upon further thought are corrected by the intellect. Examples: flame/star, wax argument, tower shape, painter analogy (perhaps).
CLarify that intellect in this sense is referring to the whole mind.

rationalism vs empiricism running through

1. Representational and Formal Reality (can merge 1 and 2)
2. Star & flame in Meditation 6
  - meaning. the two sides to it then are p3 and p4 (how it is set up and why it makes error)
  - wax. implication/extension of star & flame.
3. Mind/Body dualism, sensory doubt (M6, M1)
  - Senses arrive in the senses (body) and go to the mind/intellect
4. Error theory Meditation 4
  - Dependent on separation

## B
q explicitly separates intellect from senses (dualism). Clarify in part A that intellect is referring to whole mind, not the passive vessel.


main lines of inquiry on p3 and p4, Mind/Body (intellect and senses) and certain knowledge.
1. Attack dualism (continuous)
2. Certainty

Error: not explicitly in question
attack the whole mechanism; will and intellect is a theological point, plus it is a theodicy.

empiricism and rationalism ultimate question: what makes knowledge, knowledge? Does the intellect correct, or do we distrust it? Do we trust the intellect or senses?
