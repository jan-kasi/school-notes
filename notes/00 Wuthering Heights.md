# Content, craft and Conventions
- For IB, a large part of assessment is appreciation of the writer's craft and their artistic choices
  - how they communicate the content of what they say and depict to the reader
  - e.g. literary techniques; irony; characterisation;
  - be clear: **remember that the examiner has not been in your lessons!**

We cannot separate what the things are from how the writer presents them, they do not exist as they are until they are created by the writer

Heathcliff is a tumultuous and violent character. --> Bronte presents Heathcliff as a tumultuous and violent character, through....(technique), to explore the...(critical theory and for what reasons Bronte does this/why this is necessary)

---
# Fantasy and Realism
- Literary realism attempts to represent familiar things as they are. Realist authors chose to depict everyday and banal activities and experiences.

- Plot and characters are assessed on how believable they are, attempts to represent subject matter truthfully without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions.

- Jules Francois Champfleury--- realist literature attempts to reproduce "objective reality", showing everyday, mundane elements of life

- Realism developed partly as a reaction to the "excesses" of Romanticism and the Gothic

Features of Realist literature:
- Believable, plausible plot (links to horror vs terror in the Gothic)
- Objective narrative (or one with the illusion of objectivity!)
- "Social realism"---presenting an unflinching view of the lives of ordinary people to draw attention to their conditions
- Depicts everyday quotidian events
- Reality is knowable (exists outside of humans' conceptual schemas, narratives and subjective consciousnesses)
- Rational---reason, empiricism, objective observation prioritised over abstract emotion and Romanticism

Wuthering heights drifts into the fantastical, still plausible but not common in the way it is portrayed
Lots of unrestrained emotion and melodrama, heightened drama and Romanticist excesses the major driving force throughout the novel.
Unreality and character choices prioritised


# Gothic
"First Generation" Gothic
- late 18th century
- Ann Radcliffe, Matthew Lewis, etc.
"Second Generation" Gothic
- Mid to late 19th century
- 

Romantic movement: authenticity, emotions,

Ann Radcliffe
- Brontes, RL Stevenson, etc.

Romantic v Gothic fiction contemporary opinions later challenged:
- Gothic as sensationalist and fake, not "real" art, appealing to lesser audiences, populist, female
- Romantic as authentic and true expression, "real" art, appealing to higher audiences, male

20th century, reassessment of "high" and "low" literature

Radcliffe's differences between terror and horror
- Horror is actively destructive and damages the mind, sensational
- Terror awakens and expands the mind, authentic

Radcliffe
- Gothic terror + Romantic idea of natural beauty

Ellen Moers, the 'Female Gothic'
- Descriptive term
- The Gothic expressing female experience
- Using the Gothic genre to create political expressions
- Ann Radcliffe, Brontes, Charlotte Perkins Gilman
- (useful frame but quite a simplification of how Gothic writers relate to the real world and contextualise it, not very attentive to intersectionality and non-political context)

Wuthering heights---more about intersectionality, sets are constantly blurred and crossed between through characters and situations
- As Heathcliff climbs the class hierarchy, he becomes less gentlemanly and loses his etiquette to people but raises his appearance
- Heathcliff tears Catherine's coffin
- Heathcliff talks about exhuming Catherine's corpse and (possibly) implied necrophilia
- Comparison of Heathcliff to the devil
- Defiance of social norms and conventions of a Romantic hero
- Class anxiety (1940s-60s)
- Deliberate undermining of the upper class and hierarchy
- Irreligious and blasphemous behaviour

Heathcliff
|Villain|Anti-hero|
|---|---|
|- planned, premeditated|- personal suffering realised|
|- attacks the younger, innocent, generation (Romanticism -> childhood innocence)|- clear cause for Heathcliff's villainy, not random or pure malice for malice's sake, psychological realism|
|- Compared to the devil, violence and abuse to people, not trying to do something good|- setting and generational/chronological disruption -> "fated", tradegy genre|
|- later, abusive nature becomes defining characteristic and there is no redemption|- |
|- all "anti", no "hero" -> doesn't do bad things for a good purpose or have any good effects|- is the defiance of politics and class oppression Bronte's intention or Heathcliff's intention|

# I 01 intro
- 1847 under pseudonym Ellis Bell
- Before Jane Eyre
- Genre: bildungsroman, revenge tragedy, perhaps gothic, perhaps romance
- Setting: Yorkshire moors, Wuthering Heighs, Thrushcross Grange
- After Bronte's death, her sister edited the manuscript correcting for spelling, changing punctuation and making Joseph's Yorkshire dialect more intelligible
- Very controversial on first publication
- Bronte draws heavily on gothic fiction and the Sublime can be seen in the wild and barren moorland setting
- Challenges Victorian ideas about race, gender, class, religion, morality and prpriety

## Revenge tragedy
- genrally a dramatic genre associated with the early modern era (16/17 centurey)
- Centres around a protagonist (the avenger) who has been wronged and seeks revenge on the wrongdoers over the course of the play, and usually results in the protagonist's own downfall and death
- Madness, the supernatural, violence, murder, and villany are common features

## Things
narrative unreliability
wealth and status
nature and the sublime
social outsiders
gender
family and community
Gothic
anti-heros/villains
reflecting on british society
reason and emotion
sexality and desire
race and postcoloniaism
an alien/changeling/interloper
set in the past (Lockwood diaries dated 1801 so Nely must have been born in 1758 and Catherine's marriage took place in 1783)

---
# I ch 01-5
## Is lockwood a reliable narraor?
no, he admits to passing his own views onto others and misreading the situations often, and passes judgement very quickly.
he is an uninformed outsider who wants to hear some gossip
lack of direct knowledge
biased accounts of biased accounts.
subjective

naivete, poor judge of character (e.g. his impression of Heathcliff), unreliable self-perception (sees himself as a brooding misanthrope and in ch4 desparate to gossip with Nelly), and as tempting romantic prospect. Trying to make himself look like a brooding, mysanthropic and melancholy romantic hero.
poor powers of perception (thinks Heathcliff and Mrs h are married despite large age difference, mistakes dead rabbits for cats)


## Is nelly a reliable narrator?
no, passage of time
too involved with characters to be reliable

will she present herself accurateely?
limited information availiable to an external observer
servants not always privy to the private emotions and experiences of their masters
"I know all about it; except for...and...and.."

## characters 
Lockwood:
naive
shelterned
suthern
optimistic
lives a thrushcross grange in 1801

healthcliff:
bad tempered
experienced
curt
northern
lives in wuthering heights in 1801

## Heathcliff
- misanthrope
- difficult past
- dominant in household
- scary
- angry
- dissatisfied with world
- grief/loss
- isolated
- uncaring
- inhospitable
- outsider to some extent
- untrustwothy

## Hareton Earnshaw and Mrs Heathcliff
how are they all related?
why are they all in WH?
how did he lose the house?

## ch3
Catherine's father owned WH and died, catherine shared a childhood with Heathcliff.
Moors.
Difficuult and confused childhood.
Family wealth and status
Joseph portrayed as a villainous figure
Similarity between catherine and heathcliff
Hindley's mistreatment of Heathcliff
Heathcliff abused and tormented by almost everyone

Lockwood supposedly has an encounter with catherine's ghost.
subconscioussness influenced by diary?
ambiguity if it is real or not, Heathcliff seems to believe him immediately and it all occurs in the same room which Heathcliff has locked up for some reason.
The debate of if the supernatural is real or if it is a manifestation and construction to explain human psychology is a theme

## ch4-5
heathcliff found by catherine's father on the streets of liverpool. this is obviously suspicious, is he an illegitimate son? Liverpool was known as a bit of a hotbed for this because it is a port city during the slave trade and etc. etc.

Hindley and Catherine characterised as spoiled and upper class, self-centred.
Hindley- anger, abuse of Heathcliff.
Catherine- manipulative and clever
power struggle between the two siblings

Are we encouraged to doubt Nelly's narrative at all?

---
# I ch 06-7
## How does Hindley change during his three years away from Wuthering Heights? What is the significance of this? (p. 46) 

Commanding, desires to change WH for himself 

Change in dress 

Aware of class and propriety  

Resentment and jealousy due to father’s treatment of Heathcliff -> revenge on Heathcliff 

“degrading himself past redemption” – doesn’t try to improve himself morally and break the cycle of abuse and resentment – no attempt to improve morally, only socially 

Showing off authority and power 

Tyrannical 

## How does life at Wuthering Heights change after Hindley’s return?  

Heathcliff’s status in the house is reduced and ruined – banned from education, he becomes a servant/labourer (one of “the other servants”) 

Locks Heathcliff and Catherine out on the moors – symbolic of him locking them out of his new life and C and H’s exclusion from respectable Victorian society  

Becomes tyrannical and more abusive

## What are our first impressions of Thrushcross Grange? Are these reliable? (p. 48) 

To Catherine and Heathcliff it's conspicuous, isolated, mysterious, strange. 

Opposite to WH’s wildness – Thrushcross grange and its inhabitants described as sheltered 

Heathcliff’s biased narrative – looks down on TG (bias) and spies on them (outsider) 

## Look at the Linton family’s reaction to Heathcliff on p. 49 - 51. Is Heathcliff presented sympathetically? Why/why not? 

Heathcliff is aggressive and negative, but due to his own mistreatment, as exemplified at TG 

Disrespect, cold towards him – let the dogs attack him and only express regret when they see the dog has bitten Catherine 

“out-and-outer”, “the robbers”, “you foulmouthed thief”  

Prejudice, abuse Heathcliff faces 

## In your opinion, is Heathcliff’s immorality and darkness innate or conditioned? 
Abused by Heathcliff and Frances, cultivated resentment.

Mischievous in childhood, but not immoral or evil.

Criminality as perceived by other characters others him and the gaze makes him conform to their views.

Penalised for normal behaviour due to otherness.

Catherine treated better and punished less for the same things.

## How has Catherine changed during her time at Thrushcross Grange? How do the other characters respond to her change?

Now able to see the social divide between her and Heathcliff -> now HC notices as well

Shows class and gender ass a taught and preformative social construct, not innate

Appearance, dress, manners

Change in character based on class and gender expectations

But the authentic self is simply hidden, never completely removed

Wuthering Heights' effects on the characters in revealing and corrupting its inhabitants--metaphor for the privacy of the home for abuse and the stifling effects in society in cultivating the abuse.

Symbiotic relationship between WH and HC+Catherine

Class doesn't maintain goodness and ensure it, but corrupt it: either by enforcing itself or pushing others away form it/hiding behind it for their evil acts.

Lintons see themselves as saviours of the residents of WH, but make things worse.

Nature is not moral

## How is Nelly’s grooming of Heathcliff racialised? 

Wants him to become more like the 'respectable' residents of WH

Sense of superiority and all-knowing

Nelly from a servant family wants to be a superior class so makes Heathcliff lower by referring to race.
She does however, try to make him part of the family in a way she never could. But, narrative unreliability.

Literal things like the compliments and advice.

What is she not telling us?

Postcolonialism and Orientalism apply very nicely here.

| Postcolonial criticism                                       | Orientalist criticism                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| “like black fiends” –> linking darkness with immorality      | Exoticising  non-western cultures                            |
| Black/Bonny dichotomy she builds                             | “prince in disguise”, “Emperor of China…Indian Queen”        |
| idea of who you are on the inside “a good heart” reflects on what you look like externally. | clumsy, unrealistic. Making up his background FOR HIM and projecting onto him. He is now the master of the household, so perhaps she is doing this retroactively/in hindsight. |
| Othering                                                     | Othering                                                     |

Condescending, implicit superiority. ‘yes, you might be a prince etc. etc. but I am still better than you’

Unreliability: they do not seem on such good terms at the present and HC doesn’t speak glowingly of Nelly as a friend or someone who wanted to help.

Nelly is trying to mould Heathcliff into something she sees as appropriate

## Why does Brontë end Chapter 7 with Nelly and Lockwood speaking to each other in the present day?

Remind the reader that this is an account of an account and unreliable in many ways.

“except those in Greek, and Latin, and in French.” Similar to when she says she knows everything about Heathcliff, except x and x and x.

Foreshadowing to what she will talk about next as something unpleasant as she tries to stop and make it shorter.

- more doubt to the reliability of the next part
- suspense about what will happen next

Foregrounding that this narrative is a result of Nelly’s self-editing and retrospective guilt. She might be making this more interesting and entertaining by purposefully drawing from tropes and styles, while making herself less implicit.

reading books –> awareness of literary tropes and techniques



**Lockwood as an audience** making demands and Nelly struggling to meet them and make herself look good.

---
# I ch 8-9
## Nelly describes WH as "An infernal house", how does Bronte present WH as hellish and immoral.

Hindley is being abusive to his son.

He an alcoholic.

"The servants could not bear his [Hindley] tyrannical and evil conduct". Hindley's mourning over Frances leads to him releasing his anger on others and himself.

"He cursed and defied  - execrated God and man and gave himself up to reckless dissipation."

Catherine becomes physically violent towards Nelly and Hareton, and becomes entitled and manipulative (she is disturbed and upset when others don't let her get away from her hypocrisy)

Heathcliff becomes sadistic and lets his resentment out by watching Hindley fall "past redemption"

The inhabitants are all tortured and torturing each other/revelling in the other's suffering.

Class consciousness, aware of social hierarchy and rules

## Why might Heathcliff have tried “to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness”?

He has internalised the negative views others held from him

Projecting his bad treatment to others

His repulsion of others means he wants to make himself repulsive so he does not have to deal with them

Isolation –> due to setting ans outsider status

Awareness of social class and inability to be accepted by society

## Relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff

two sides of Catherine’s character and future life

Names carved into windows -> foreshadowing as she chooses her path and life consequences

Increasing independence from childhood companion

Changing dependency towards Edgar

Awareness of life away from WH

TG seems idyllic/utopian but hides corruption — WH  displays corruption clearly

Repress emotions to fulfil social expectations of class and gender

## Do you agree with Nelly that the brutal, violent, passionate behaviour is Catherine’s “genuine disposition”

In the way which she is presented, yes. But this could be narrative unreliability and Nelly’s dislike of her.

Tried to change in TG but couldn’t maintain it.

Even in early childhood, Nelly hints at her being manipulative, selfish, and entitled.

However, this could be the social conditioning. It is not that it is a natural disposition, but a genuine one.

## Why does Linton return to WH after Catherine’s outburst

Perhaps he likes it

He wants to be this upper class saviour character, saviour-complex: bringing Catherine back into acceptable society

Catherine is “his idol”, he is infatuated with her.

Nelly could be blowing everything up because she dislikes Catherine. Would Edgar really return if Catherine’s behaviour had been as bad as she described it to be, perhaps it was just a heated argument.


## 9
Why does chapter begin with Hindley throwing Hareton down the stairs before recounting Nelly and Catherine's talk?
- Symbolic of Hareton's degradation and descent by being thrown by others
- Edgar's stability compared to violence/immorality/fear of WH
- Humanity of Heathcliff, he catches Hareton even though it was an opportunity for revenge; it suggests his instinct and impulse is to save and be good, even though he later regrets it: he is conditioned to be bad and spiteful

What motivates Catherine's marriage to Edgar?
- "handsome, young, cheerful, rich" and "loves" Catherine
- even if she doesn't love him, she is loved by him and he offers an escape

---
# I ch 10-11
## Chapter 10

How is Wuthering Heights shown to be physically or emotionally corrupting? You can use examples from other sections of the text as well.
- Lockwood becomes ill
- Hindley loses money in gambling.


What gaps or inconsistencies are there in Nelly’s story?


Why do you think Catherine forces Linton and Heathcliff’s hands together? Think about Catherine’s motivations and Brontë’s intentions as a writer.
- Catherine wants to both have her cake and eat it, as it were.
- Brontë perhaps wants to make a point as to the forceful shoving-together of incompatible people (both socially and character-wise) by others?

In what ways has Heathcliff changed or not changed during his absence?
- He is still resentful and mischievous
- He appears much more confident and aware
- He is still very harsh on people

How is Catherine’s relationship with Linton presented?
- As one where Catherine gets almost everything she wants and puts Linton in uncomfortable situations

How is Isabella Linton characterised?
- As childish and more innocent, someone the others see as needing to protect.

## Chapter 11

How are Hindley and Hareton presented at the beginning of this chapter? What is Brontë showing through the change in their characters? 
- Small child Hareton begins to curse at Nelly and is violent towards her.
- Reference to threats of violence
- Brontë is showing the effects which WH has on people and the effect Heathcliff is purposefully causing
- Hindley is portrayed as losing much of his power and authority 

Why does Heathcliff become angry on p. 111-2? Think about what we are told explicitly and what you can infer from the novel as a whole.
- He isn't respected, Catherine still sees him the same way

In what ways does Brontë present Catherine and Heathcliff as wild and uncontrollable?
- They are both very passionate and verbally harsh to each other
- They both act as if they can take anything they want
- They are physically threatening and unnerving, Heathcliff's strength and threats and Catherine's purposeful fits of rage.
- They both attempt to manipulate people and grow angry when it fails

Why does Catherine lock herself, Nelly, Linton and Heathcliff in the room together? Think about Catherine’s motivations and Brontë’s intentions as a writer.


How does Brontë contrast Linton’s weakness and Catherine’s passion? Find quotes and examples and explain what devices Brontë uses to characterise the two figures.


## How is Heathcliff and Catherine's relationship presented by Bronte?
### Class debate summary

| Positively                                                   | Negatively                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| conventional romantic characterisation of heathcliff (tragedy, misanthropy, Romantic?) | Nothing massively bad happens while Heathcliff is away, he purposefully comes in for revenge and to “win” Catherine |
| heathcliff’s outsider status makes the reader more sympathetic to him | Their love is fundamentally doomed, tragic, and blindingly wild: it is destructive |
| Catherine’s insincerity and lack of honesty about her love for edgar —> C’s honesty about HC’s flaws shows she accepts him, even his shortcomings | Loss of individual idenity when they are together “I am Heathcliff” |
| C+HC’s love =eternal and transcendent; C+E’s love based on ephemeral, worldly thing, e.g. wealth, status | C+HC’s relationship characterised by the conflict, violence, arguments, etc. It is dysfunctional |
| C’s excitement at HC’s return                                | Catherine is dependant on Heathcliff because they have suffered together, not because she loves him |
| HC’s flaws explored through Nelly’s unreliable narration —> negaive aspects of C+HC told through biased perspective as she supports Edgar over Heathcliff | Catherine is romanticising the ideas of eternal and tragic love (a little like Mishima!!!) |
| More similar                                                 | bronte is proto-feminist, is she really saying that women should be entirely consumed by a male partner and need (“necessary”) him. |
| “Downfall” is C’s ability to become her true self and abandon false attatchment to Edgar | C feels she needs a relationship                             |
| Close relationship and counter to the norm of the victorian marriage convention | Relationship almost incestuous—> dysfunctional and destructive, e.g. Oedipus, Lot |
| Heathcliff is the only person who can handle Catherine. BUT does Catherine need to be handled? ALSO, Linton is very capable. | All relationships are bad with Catherine, almost like her peroson is a Hamartia |
|                                                              | HC abandoned Catherine and retrurns for his own motivations  |

# I ch 12-14
## 12
Why does Brontë show Catherine starving herself? Think about Catherine’s motivations and Brontë’s intentions as a writer.
- Catherine's instability and pettiness is shown again, she is shown to be violent to others and willing to even starve herself to death out of spite and anger
- Nelly appears less responsible as Catherine shown as deranged

What elements of Gothic fiction does Brontë use in this chapter?
- Wild and abandoned, while imprisoning, setting (constant)
- Strange illness and madness
- Catherine locked in her room and Edgar stuck in books
- Catherine's surprising strength, almost supernatural/out of madness
- Catherine talks about how if she dies her spirit won't rest until it is with Heathcliff, ghosts and death 
- Social crisis
- The possible falsity of Catherine's illness, doubt about the real
- Her illness as *uncanny*, Nelly recalls her previous illness---this is something new and different but links to the past

Catherine says that she is “so changed” (p. 125). What could she be referring to? There could be more than one interpretation.
- Her attitudes towards Edgar and Heathcliff
- Her love/lack of love
- Her motivations
- Her mind, perhaps

Why does Catherine want to go to the moors and open a window? Think about Catherine’s motivations and Brontë’s intentions as a writer.
- The uncanny and supernatural, it is strange that she wants to open the window and claims to see WH from there
- As a way to then threaten to jump out
- As a tool for manipulation/to sell the scam, if it is one
- Perhaps if she has a fever then she wants to cool down
- Further the theme of the Gothic
- To further show how demanding Catherine is
- A way for Nelly to push forward the view that Catherine doesn't know what's good for her

Look at p. 126-8. Why do you think Catherine is so preoccupied with death?
- She is dying, perhaps
- She has a fever
- She recalls her father's death and the following trauma?
- As a reference to Gothic themes
- 

In what ways could Nelly be said to exhibit poor judgement in this chapter? How does this affect the reader’s view of her?
- She doesn't believe Catherine and is untruthful about many things
- Perhaps she is not being very truthful now, if she lied to keep up appearances then she might be doing much of the same now

## 13
How does Brontë show that Isabella’s status has fallen?
- She writes a letter to Nelly instead of anyone else, and is unable to write
- She says she has made a mistake

## 14
Why does Brontë have Heathcliff hang Isabella’s dog? Think about Heathcliff’s motivations and Brontë’s intentions as a writer.
- To very clearly visualise Heathcliff's sadism and cruelty, Heathcliff wants to hurt Isabella in place of Edgar and Catherine and take out all his anger, he is not a good person
- Heathcliff wants to leave a message to the family and frighten them
- To show the extent of Heathcliff's anger

Look at Heathcliff’s dialogue on p. 148. Are there any similarities between what he says here and how Catherine describes their relationship?
- He is as forceful as Catherine is and as certain of their love as Catherine was
- He claims he will do whatever it takes and never rest until he is with Catherine, similar to how she says even her spirit will seek out Heathcliff
- They are both threatening and frightening

Is Heathcliff a hero, an anti-hero or a villain? Is there a clear answer? Use examples to support your argument.
- Violent sexuality against Isabella
- Manipulative
- Villain, he is sadistic and abusive, and comes to forcefully take Catherine doing anything it takes
- He thinks himself a hero however
- Nelly is quite possibly making Heathcliff into more of a villain, yet Lockwood's account near the beginning might suggest it is not a massive exaggeration

Look at the bottom of p. 152, where Heathcliff talks about “duty and humanity”. What thematic similarities can you see between this section and Jane Eyre? How do the writers conform or differ in their depiction of these themes?
- Haven't read Jane Eyre, so I have no idea

How does Nelly defend her actions at the end of this chapter? Do you find her convincing? Why/why not?
- Claimed to refuse Heathcliff 50 times, which is unconvincing as she would have been very frightened if Heathcliff had really been as threatening. Either she quickly agreed or Heathcliff was not so violent
- Could have lied by agreeing and not doing anything, she has done similar things so not an outrageous suggestion
- Describes herself reflecting and struggling over the decision to make it seem a difficult one
- As she had previously described wanting Catherine to almost 'get what she deserves', I find it unrealistic that her loyalties change so much as to want to now protect her
- She now claims she thought it was "wrong, though expedient", as to suggest she knows better now

# II ch 01
Initially establish the unreliability of Nelly, what causes Lockwood to call her a "fair" narrator, simply that she tells a good story?

White dress is a reference to the ghost of Catherine which Lockwood thinks he sees.

Many elements of the Gothic in Catherine's descriptions
Frailty of the flesh
Madness
The mortal body

Catherine's anger and grief

"as mad as yourself"---Catherine driven to madness, or at least perceived as


Very :sparkles: ***dramatic*** :sparkles: reunion

Catherine's idea of heaven, neither TG or WH

Depersonalisation and entrapment
Narcissistic personality
obsessive compulsions?
Dissociation from body perhaps, but it wasn't really a studied thing and doesn't really seem like what she is describing, she more seems trapped inside and tired of life instead of dissociated.
More imprisonment in TG, marriage, society, and health/life

Narcissistic and harmful love

Nelly portrays Catherine as almost evil
Suggests she needs to get rid of her person as well as body to get into heaven

Social tragedy

Links to Romeo and Juliet? Perhaps a corrupted love of the stars, or one of circumstance instead of written in the stars. But different as R\&J are forced apart, and C\&H together.

Nelly is more horrified by the passionate and deviant sexuality than an objective narrator might have as she is so conventional.

Heathcliff and Catherine both constantly guilt trip each other

## How do Catherine and Heathcliff feel out each other?
Aggrieved and passionate.
They both feel abandoned by each other
Is their hatred genuine?
They are both selfishly obsessed with each other
Toxic, they do not care if they're happy

Heathcliff seems conflicted, though how genuine this is is questionable.

External and internal conflict.

## What type of love is it?
Narcissistic love which they feel is "necessary"
Idea of being literal soulmate
Religious ecstasy

Subversion of Gothic, wants to be haunted.
Says it doesn't matter if they are happy, she can be dead but she needs to be there---selfish

---
# II ch 2-6

### ch 6
Linton wants Edgar to accompany him, and treats this going away as a 'moving house' thing rather than the imprisonment it'll be 
- LINK TO GOTHIC :D 
Nelly takes him to the Heights, and tries to portray it in a good light. 
- Heathcliff puts on a show of happiness, but Linton is more frightened than anything and understands little of what Heathcliff and Joseph say 
- The way Heathcliff talks is quite dated; represents their societal isolation. 
- This is where Heathcliff vocalises his 'big plan' (page 208): 
> “my son is prospective owner of your place, and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his successor. Besides, he’s mine, and I want the triumph of seeing my descendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children to till their fathers’ lands for wages. That is the sole consideration which can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate him for the memories he revives! But that consideration is sufficient: he’s as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master tends his own. I have a room upstairs, furnished for him in handsome style; I’ve engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from twenty miles’ distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn. I’ve ordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I’ve arranged everything with a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his associates. I do regret, however, that he so little deserves the trouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a worthy object of pride; and I’m bitterly disappointed with the whey-faced, whining wretch!” (https://www.gutenberg.org/files/768/768-h/768-h.htm) 

- Linton not liking the milk porridge highlights his isolation both up north and in the Heights. 

- Linton immediately hates it; all Nelly does despite his protests is leave. 

## Class discussion
### Structure
Volume I and II are divided by Catherine's death. What is the effect of this?
- The previous characters are archetypes for the incoming people. 
- Catherine is the binding character between the incoming people. 
- Catherine is the first person Lockwood sees as a ghost and she is the person that starts off the story 
- It fragments the story into a story about multiple people and their individual relationships instead of many people in a collective relationship. 
- The outsider who is now coming in - Isabella's son
- It is almost like Catherine has returned through Cathy, they share the same name, tie everyone together in a similar way, act similarly 
- It continues the timeline which means that there is now an era of Catherine. 
- It amplifies the theme of doubles

What does each volume focus on?
Volume 1:
- Relationship between the original characters
Volume 2:	
 -The effects that these relationships had 
Volume 1 plants the seeds for Heathcliff's revenge whereas volume two shows him carrying out this revenge 

What changes between volumes one and two?
- Catherine dies and the birth of her daughter 
- Isabella dies and the birth of her daughter 
- Heathcliff kills Hindley and gains Hareton
- Heathcliff new proprietor of Wuthering Heights

nature: doomed to recreate their parent's actions
nurture: doomed to their actions by growing up in a highly dysfunctional environment

Heathcliff enters as unwanted outsider to WH, Linton enters as wanted outsider to TG

Vol I characters as archetypes for Vol II - Catherine's omnipresence and 'haunting' of the narrative
- C is the crucial character linking the two generations - generation divide
Fragmentation of relationships and characters

H+C as a 'unifying' narrative focal point in Vol I --> focus split between characters in Vol II - reversal of fortunes (tragedy)

Vol I as a template for Vol II --> nature or nurture in replicating behaviour of former generations

### Doubles
Pairs:
- Catherine and Heathcliff
- Heathcliff vs Hindley (siblings)
- Heathcliff vs Edgar (rival lovers)
- Thrushcross Grove vs Wuthering Heights
- Houses vs Moors
- Human vs Nature
- Linton vs Hareton
- Young Catherine and Young Heathcliff
- Cathy and Heathcliff
- Cathy and Edgar
- Past and Present narration
- Narrative voices
- Lockwood as outsider
- Insiders and Outsiders

- reader vs writer

Lintons = refined, proper, socially respected, generally nicer/"good" people
Earnshaws/Heathcliff = unrefined, socially complex, generally meaner/"bad" people

C and H innocent attachment corrupted by society and TG (brings the expectations)

Gothic doubles
- Duality within a character between good and evil
- Catherine's fluctuations in behaviour
- Young and Old
Doppelganger
- Psychological state
- Supernatural
- Double or mirror image of a person, with an uncanny side
- Repressed or dark side
- Freud, the uncanny
- Quest for individual identity -> link to society

### Characterisation
Young Cathy:
- Physical appearance similar to Catherine, deceptive exterior
- Heathcliff's hatred due to resemblance to Catherine
- Defiance of Nelly
Hareton:
- Corrupted and status declined
- Heathcliff's revenge/victory and exploitation
- Made to be a servant like Heathcliff was

Characters share names:
- Cyclical nature of the two houses, perhaps like a commentary on the perpetual effect of society to do this
  - Inevitable
  - Tragic links
- Past houses still remain
- Breaking of a cycle more noticeable
- Hubris, perhaps?
- Does Heathcliff manage to break the cycle or perpetuates it
- Death of son = chance to end the cycle 
Heathcliff as a possessive character
- Holds Hareton and Linton captive
- Owns WH and TG to defy social constraints
  - Chooses to destroy the houses and their associated families

Heathcliff's motivations for raising Linton
- To spite Edgar
- Possessiveness
- Defy Edgar's (perceived?) saviour complex
- Heir, act of defiance/reclamation
- Linton's status as an outsider reflects HC's role (that he also took with Catherine)

Heathcliff perhaps blames Cathy as killing Catherine and stealing her (due to uncanny resemblance)

Nelly
- Abandons Linton even after witnessing abuse and slander
- Increases sympathy for Linton
- Negative view of Nelly
  - Nelly is telling the story, if Nelly looks bad then, then how bad was it actually?
- Servant/Master relationship / Class criticism

### Themes
Conflicts between nature and civilisation
- Children
  - Inability to act freely, even though they want to/act so
  - Family
  - Even "instinctive" parental love is corrupted by the environment
- Edgar/TG = civilisation
- HC/WH = primal nature??? or perhaps corrupted civilisation, this I find more likely
- Death in childbirth = natural process. but forced by society/civilisation
- Catherine's grave between the two houses = symbolic of Catherine's conflict between civilisation and nature (and savagery?)
- Hareton = servant and not in "civilisation", but actually her cousin in nature

- Pregnancy
  - Did Edgar even know before so, Nelly even?
  - We don't know until it happens, perhaps a satire of Victorian society's taboo against pregnant women who have to stay out of sight and become hysterical

Contemporary anxieties about class in Victorian age
- Blurring of class hierarchy and distinction
- Hubris and reversals of fortune
- Immediate loathing of HC on arrival at WH
- Catherine tries to level the divide but can't
- Usurping of the upper class' power
- Hatred due to jealousy (Nelly and Joseph) or class prejudice (Hindley)
- Reasons for the lower classes wanting to change the system

Symbolism:
- "desert" = escapism, desire, desolate and alone, beyond/transcending WH and TG (nature transcending society?)
- Dogs get into a fight: TG and WH always collide and in conflict, resulting in injury
  - dogs return to the house with swollen head and bleeding ear (foreshadowing Catherine's return to the house and her distress). Ehhh, not a great point
  - Catherine's puppy= youth, kindness, Hareton's caring nature even though he has been through a lot
    - Catherine's rejection of it = stubbornness, privilege, ungratefulness, class prejudice
- "scrawny body", vulnerability, reflecting his upbringing by the Lintons (sheltered, spoiled), physical and mental weakness, emphasises the differences between Heathcliff and his son
  - Similarity to Isabella/reminder he is her daughter, Heathcliff hates Isabella
  - Heathcliff doesn't see himself in him

# II ch 7-12
## Heathcliff
### Heathcliff's plan
- Heathcliff sees himself as a mastermind of a plan
- Trying to push Catherine and Linton to marry, allowing him to control both houses
- Context: Cathy may not be able to inherit Linton's property

### Ends of ch 11 and 12
- References to death and tyranny, Heathcliff increasingly ominous and uncaring
- Linton fading from the narrative as he slowly dies
- Uncertainty and mistrust, e.g. "what to hide and what to reveal"

### Heathcliff's treatment of Hareton and Linton
- Punishing Hareton for Hindley's transgressions against him
- Vengeance as primary motivator -> link to revenge tragedy genre
- Lack of family and parental background -> uses Linton to secure his plan
  - highlights HC's misanthropy
  - even his son is manipulated and despised
- He is becoming the bad character, becoming worse than the person he is trying to punish
  - Almost like a Gothic double

## Edgar Linton
### EL's change over the course of the book
- physical weakness
- psychological weakness, he is unable to manipulate others as he did before
- Loses control over Cathy ("abandon her to him") and awareness of her actions
- Then loses even more control as he loses to Hareton
- Loses control from complete forbidding to moderate punishments

- Sympathy for Edgar changes
  - He seems more manipulated and weak as HC becomes more tyrannical
  - Sees Catherine being manipulated, but participates in this anyway
  - Pathos, he thinks that if he dies then Cathy will be completely under HC's mercy (but she still is even when EL is alive)
  - Guilt tripping Catherine
  - Thinks he knows what will make Cathy happy

## Nelly
- Narrative voice
- Midpoint/messenger between EL and Cathy (again, except TG and WG characters switched)
- Knows and influences both the 
- Portrays herself as trustworthy and knowing everything
- Unreliability
  - Nelly's sickness but still talks as if she has first hand info
  - Cathy cares for Nelly
  - Almost writes herself as a crime novel where she figures it all out
  - Inconsistency in telling Cathy about the severity of characters' illnesses
  - Portrays herself as moral and makes her case for Cathy being a great person to marry
  - Timeless perspective spanning all generations -> inconsistencies
    - Allusions to different generations saying very similar things and acting in very similar ways

## Cathy, Hareton and Linton




## Parallels
- Gothic theme of past and present closely related and linked
