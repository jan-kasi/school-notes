# Gothic
"First Generation" Gothic
- late 18th century
- Ann Radcliffe, Matthew Lewis, etc.
"Second Generation" Gothic
- Mid to late 19th century
- 

Romantic movement: authenticity, emotions,

Ann Radcliffe
- Brontes, RL Stevenson, etc.

Romantic v Gothic fiction contemporary opinions later challenged:
- Gothic as sensationalist and fake, not "real" art, appealing to lesser audiences, populist, female
- Romantic as authentic and true expression, "real" art, appealing to higher audiences, male

20th century, reassessment of "high" and "low" literature

Radcliffe's differences between terror and horror
- Horror is actively destructive and damages the mind, sensational
- Terror awakens and expands the mind, authentic

Radcliffe
- Gothic terror + Romantic idea of natural beauty

Ellen Moers, the 'Female Gothic'
- Descriptive term
- The Gothic expressing female experience
- Using the Gothic genre to create political expressions
- Ann Radcliffe, Brontes, Charlotte Perkins Gilman
- (useful frame but quite a simplification of how Gothic writers relate to the real world and contextualise it, not very attentive to intersectionality and non-political context)

Wuthering heights---more about intersectionality, sets are constantly blurred and crossed between through characters and situations
- As Heathcliff climbs the class hierarchy, he becomes less gentlemanly and loses his etiquette to people but raises his appearance
- Heathcliff tears Catherine's coffin
- Heathcliff talks about exhuming Catherine's corpse and (possibly) implied necrophilia
- Comparison of Heathcliff to the devil
- Defiance of social norms and conventions of a Romantic hero
- Class anxiety (1940s-60s)
- Deliberate undermining of the upper class and hierarchy
- Irreligious and blasphemous behaviour

Heathcliff
|Villain|Anti-hero|
|---|---|
|- planned, premeditated|- personal suffering realised|
|- attacks the younger, innocent, generation (Romanticism -> childhood innocence)|- clear cause for Heathcliff's villainy, not random or pure malice for malice's sake, psychological realism|
|- Compared to the devil, violence and abuse to people, not trying to do something good|- setting and generational/chronological disruption -> "fated", tradegy genre|
|- later, abusive nature becomes defining characteristic and there is no redemption|- |
|- all "anti", no "hero" -> doesn't do bad things for a good purpose or have any good effects|- is the defiance of politics and class oppression Bronte's intention or Heathcliff's intention|
