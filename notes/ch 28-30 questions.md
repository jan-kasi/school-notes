# ch 28-30 questions

1. What do you think is meant by the closing line of the novel?
Candide changing his views. We have to work for and accept what we get, not expect for everything to be the best. Instead of passively waiting for perfection, actively trying to improve without any expectation that it will be perfect.
Instead of fousing on thinking/useless philosophy, we should focus on pragmatic and useful philosophy.
Less focus on the abstract "that is well said" and more on the practical "cultivate"
Being in the moment, contrast between Pangloss' reflection on their extraordinary adventure and Candide's focus on the immediate.
Acceptance
2. How would you summarise the overall message of the novel? Is there one?
Inadequacy and ironic nature of Optimism as a philosopy and attitude.
Acceptance.
Things do not have to be perfect to be happy, often it is the other way around.
Critique of power: kings, religion, wealth.
Critique of society and how it oppresses.
Striving for wealth, power, perfection, social influence, etc. does not make you happy, but rather miserable.  
3. Which genre do you feel Candide best exemplifies as why â€“ e.g. picaresque, satire, fantasy, realism, something else entirely?

4. Did you like the novel? Why/why not?
