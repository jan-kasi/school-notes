# 27 Criticising distinction in ideas
a. Explain the **distinction** Descartes makes between innate, adventitious and factitious ideas. [10]
- You have to very clearly say what the distinctions are (and what they are)
- Innate ideas a rationalist idea

b. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the distinctions Descartes makes. [15]
- Go after the existence of innate ideas - empiricism vs rationalism (Locke and Carruthers)
- Use Hobbes' attack
- Use Gassendi's attack
- Locke
- Adventitious and factitious ideas: empiricism vs rationalism
