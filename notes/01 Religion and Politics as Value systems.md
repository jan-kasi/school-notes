# 01 Religion and Politics as Value systems
## Nietzsche
Did not believe christian values were a suitable model for morals of modern individuals
Cultural revolution
Freeing ourselves
Schopenhauer and Wagner were his first main influences


His work divided into Early, Middle, and Late periods
Picked on individuals to aspire to be, a higher type of creative genius.

Rejected, nationalism, imperialism, and power politics.

Interested in creating the groundwork for life-affirming philosophy and a cultural revolution and rejuvenation for a new class of "higher men".

### The birth of Tragedy
(I've read this!)

Greek Tragedy was the highest form of art
- The decline of Greek Tragedy was repeating similarly but for the culture of Germany

The Apolline and Dyonisiac
- Apolline was reason and representation, the most distinct and individual. Poetry and Sculpture.
- Dyonisiac was the passion. Music.

Rationalism heralded the decline of Tragedy and culture

An appropriate balance between the two oppositions required
- Emphasis on reason (Apolline) drained the meaning of life.
- An increase in the Dyonisiac is necessary to regain this meaning and passion, art, music, etc.

### Middle period
More inclined towards a psychological understanding of himself and others

Hellenistic idea of philosophy as a way of life.
Philosophy as therapeutic and life-affirming solution to life denying-nihilism

The narcissist: philosophical reflection could cool the excesses in emotion.

Satirised the inflated ego of an infantile drive to heroism, we should acknowledge the tragic and humour of life and the finitude of ourselves

### Later period
"God is Dead"
- Objection to how religion organised society, prescribes a particular moral system which is damaging to society and the individual
- We are losing the need for God but maintain the religious values

Christianity criticised glory and strength and enforced pity, meekness and weakness. This is a life denying philosophy.
- Morality of the Judeo-christian religious ideas arose from the negative desire to constrain others rather than assert own power and creativity.
- Designation of people as evil arose as a designation of impotence and resentment
- This occurred in Christianity as slave morality, based on the idea of resentment. A fear and hate of the more active and powerful attempting to pull them down.

We shouldn't value these things


People haven't questioned the underlying assumptions of the systems we are living in. These assumptions and values are judeo-christian ones even if individuals are not religious.

**Both religious and political beliefs come form underlying value judgements we may be unaware of**


## Ideas from Nietzsche-chan
Underlying assumptions and value-judgements we are unaware of
Life-affirming vs life-denying and slave-morality
Apolline and Dyonisiac opposition
Self-improvement
...

Nietzsche wants to show everyone that there is an underlying value system (perhaps as dependant on the episteme [Foucault]) they are unaware of and is destroying them.
Life has no meaning, but there is a whole value system you are operating under and are unaware of which is controlling you. One needs to take control.
