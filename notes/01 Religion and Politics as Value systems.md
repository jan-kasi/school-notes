# 01 Religion and Politics as Value systems

Did not believe christian values were a suitable model for morals of modern individuals

Cultural revolution

Freeing ourselves


Schoppenhauer and Wagner were his first main influences



His work divided into Early, Middle, and Late periods

Picked on individuals to aspire to be, a highre type of creative genius.

Rejected, nationalism, imperialism, and power politics.

Interested in creating the groundwork for life-affirming philosophy and a cultural revolution and rejuvination for a new class of "higher men".

## The birth of Tradgedy
Greek Tradgedy was the highest form of art
Decline of Greek Tradgedy was possible to occur similarly but for the culture of Germany

The Apolline and Dyonisiac
Apolline was reason and representation, the most distinct and individual. Poetry and Sculpture.
Dyonisiac the passion. Music.

Rationalism heralded the decline of Tradgedy and culture

An appropriate balance between the two oppositions required
Emphasis on reason (Apolline) drained the meaning of life.
An increase in the Dyonisiac is necessary to regain this meaning and passion, art, music, etc.

## Middle period
More inclinded towards a psychological understanding of himself and others

Hellinistic idea of philosophy as a way of life.
Philosophy as therapeutic and life-affirming solution to life denying-nihilism

The narcissit: philosophical reflection could cool the excesses in emotion.

Satirised the inflated ego of an infantile drive to heroism, we should acknowlage the tagic and humou of life and the finitude of oursleves

## "God is Dead"
Objection to how religion organised society, prescribes a particular moral system which is damaging to society and the individual
We are losing the need for God but maintain the religious values

Christianity criticised glory and strength and engorced pity, meekness and weakness. This is a life denying philosophy.

Morality of the judeo-christian religious ideas arose from the negative desire to constrain others rather than assert own power and creativity.

Designation of people as evil arose as a designation of impotnse and resentment

This occured in christianity as slave morality, based on the idea of resentement (resentment). A fear and hate of the more active and powerful attempting to pull them down.

We shouldn't value these things



People haven't questioned the underlying assumptions of the systems we are living in. These assumptions and values are judeo-christian ones even if individuals are not religious.

**Both religious and political beliefs come form underlying value judgements we may be unaware of**


## Ideas from Nietzche-chan
Underlying assumptions and value-judgements we are unaware of
Life-affirming vs life-denying and slave-morality
Apolline and Dyonisiac opposition
Self-improvement
...

Nietzche wants to show the herd that there is an underlying value system (perhaps as dependant on the episteme [Foucault]) they are unaware of and is destroying them.
Life has no meaning, but there is a whole value system you are operating under and are unaware of which is controlling you. One needs to take control.
