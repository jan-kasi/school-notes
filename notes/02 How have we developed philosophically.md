# 02 How have we developed philosophically
paragraph written about my position on philosophy

15 minute paragraph rewritten
Philosophy is the pursuit for a greater sense of understanding of meaning
which could generate some system. This aim could be greater understanding of
what morality is and what it means for us, understanding our place in the word,
finding a reason for existence and understanding it, or many others. The only
requirement is that this aim is for some sense of increased awareness of
meaning and understanding that sense, where the pursuit leads to does not
change if it is philosophy or not. The method by which this is done is through
reflection and justification striving towards the generation of some sort of
system.
When put together, this differentiates philosophy from other disciplines. For
example, in the natural sciences we could look for a greater understanding of
what is and how it works, for example how a cell replicates or how energy
works. As there is no search for understanding meaning, it is not philosophy on
its own. From something like literature where the aim might be to understand
the meaning of a text or how it reflects something, there’s no necessary search
for this reflection of meaning to generate a system.
It is possible for something to become philosophy, if one searches for how a
cell works and from doing this generates a system of what it means to be
human, the natural science part moves towards philosophy by establishing this
meaning and structure. That doesn’t make the initial parts philosophy, they
may be stepping stones towards it but not philosophy. Similarly, if one tries to
generate this but fails it could be called an attempt at a philosophical system
using philosophy.
This generation of meaning-systems functions to provide some basis for
organisation and decisions. The system which is a product of philosophy may
be used to build upon something else or build to something from it. This might
change the aim of what one is doing, so it is no longer philosophy. Philosophy
then is an active process and the product, what happens before the process or
with the product is not necessarily philosophy.
It could be said that the purpose of philosophy, what it wants to achieve—
different from the aim within philosophy, what the process aims to discover or
understand—is then vacant. This allows the philosopher to place their own
purpose for the process. This nature allows one to consider many things
philosophy, as one thinker’s ideas of what philosophy is could be placed within
the purpose part of this position of what philosophy is by the other. For
example, if one reads work from Nietzche’s middle period where he focuses on
philosophy as a therapeutic life-affirming solution to life-denying nihilism by
providing a way of life, it can be considered philosophy with the purpose of this.
It aims to generate a system, or in this case perhaps provide the means for one
to individually do so, through it’s process. Works can then also be considered philosophical, they do not need to aim
towards a greater sense of understanding of meaning and a system from this.
From the previous example of a possible aim for literature, one could consider a
novel which inspires the reader or author to reflect in this method of philosophy
and therefore consider it to be philosophical. The reflections someone might
write in an essay about anything could be philosophical in that they are
reflections of the author or in that they cause the reader to reflect too. Works
which are philosophy are therefore inherently philosophi
