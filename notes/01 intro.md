# 01 intro
- 1847 under pseudonym Ellis Bell
- Before Jane Eyre
- Genre: bildungsroman, revenge tragedy, perhaps gothic, perhaps romance
- Setting: Yorkshire moors, Wuthering Heighs, Thrushcross Grange
- After Bronte's death, her sister edited the manuscript correcting for spelling, changing punctuation and making Joseph's Yorkshire dialect more intelligible
- Very controversial on first publication
- Bronte draws heavily on gothic fiction and the Sublime can be seen in the wild and barren moorland setting
- Challenges Victorian ideas about race, gender, class, religion, morality and prpriety

## Revenge tragedy
- genrally a dramatic genre associated with the early modern era (16/17 centurey)
- Centres around a protagonist (the avenger) who has been wronged and seeks revenge on the wrongdoers over the course of the play, and usually results in the protagonist's own downfall and death
- Madness, the supernatural, violence, murder, and villany are common features
