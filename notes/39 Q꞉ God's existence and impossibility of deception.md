# 39 Q: God's existence and impossibility of deception

a. Explain the link between God's existence, power, goodness and the impossibility of deception.
b. Evaluate the link between God's existence, power, goodness and the impossibility of deception.

no CDP

## A

Question:
Statement 1: God exists and is omnipotent and benevolent (perfection)
Statement 2: God does not deceive humans (impossible for God to deceive humans)
Descartes' recognises that we err and needs to explain it, and disprove the Deceiving God hypothesis as indubitably incoherent such that it becomes possible to have certainty.
Descartes needs to reconcile three statements, as they are his foundations for his epistemological project.
A. God exists
B. We err
C. God is no deceiver

S1. Contingency/Trademark (causal), establish God's nature, existence and power [B: Hume's challenge, as a posteriori]
S2. M4 part 1 God doesn't deceive ("the will to deceive [is undoubtedly evidence of malice or weakness and so] cannot apply to God" p43); S3. M4 error theory
(S4. Ontological impossibility conceptually and actually for deceiving God.)

"has existence as essence/eq;" (M3 ontological, causa sui, impossibility of deception)
God's existence comes about by the nature of God itself (Ontological argument) as God is perfect, in perfection the essence of existence is found.

"the power to create is the same as the power to preserve/eq;"
Existing and preserving are powers. God's power means that he alone has the power to exist causa sui, as his perfection includes existence but he alone is able to by his own power realise this essence into actually existing.

"the will to deceive.../eq; M4"
Perfection cannot have defects by definition, God is perfect therefore good. What is good is good because God made it so and could have made it otherwise, however there cannot be good before God as God set the parameters for goodness when creating; therefore it is God's existence which allows his goodness to be good and for good to be good.

And it is God's power which allows his existence (which he has) to be realised.

The God which exists by the ontological argument must exist as a good god, i.e. not a deceiving God, as otherwise he would be imperfect and therefore not necessarily exist, even with the power to. Moreover, imperfection would mean he does not have the power to do this to begin with.

One cannot attempt to claim that we could misunderstand perfection and goodness such that God is good but still deceive (perhaps links to "mysterious ways"), as if we think CDP that deception is bad and an imperfection it is not that God could have made it otherwise or it can be good as our perception and the criteria for axiological statements are set by God prior to goodness. Therefore God's goodness means that the God which ontologically exists as Good must be good and exist, through his own power.

This means that it is an impossibility for deception, as this requires a deceiving God which is both incoherent and impossible by God's nature; and God's nature means he exists, therefore there exists a perfect, good, non-deceiving God, and as such it is an impossibility for God's deception and therefore the hyperbolic deception in doubt BOTH conceptually and in reality.

This solves the broader problem of making hyperbolic doubt incoherent such that Descartes' can solve the problem of doubt due to the deceiver, and thus trust the divine guarantee for CDR/link to indirect doubt allowing acceptance of Cartesian circularity as no longer a problem.

HOWERVER, sometimes we make mistakes!
"deception is a defect/eq;", "we sometimes err/eq;"
Sometimes we make mistakes, Descartes' needs to justify that this error is not to be blamed on God (theory of error, as theodicy).
For us to be deceived, there must exist a deceiving God.
Theory of errors/theodicy absolves God of the blame that we make errors.

## B

1. Causal Argument
- Attack existence of God (idea of God, not proof), by implication take out idea of power and goodness. Establish a gap in the link. Gassendi, Hume.
- Attack nature of God proof, Hume, Hobbes.
- Attack self-evident Levels of Reality (careful: caution, it is about the nature of the causal argument; you want to evaluate the nature of the link in the question and attacking the argument for the premises can be more directly done)
2. Error
- Gassendi, God could have made things more perfect. (can still accept that humans are the cause of error)
- Caton, inconsistency of Judgement and Assent.
- Ragland theodicy only justifies how we are able to err, not when we actually do err (i.e. why do we misuse faculty/not have an intellect large enough to make it so much more reliable).
- ... God is the reason for error (Ragland: if God did not want to deceive me, why give me a faculty which we can misuse. Even if it is perfect and we are misusing it, the blame lies on God as causing error by giving us a misusable faculty)
3. 



Is Descartes' too entrenched in Catholisism and its paradigm?
- Denial that God can be a deceiver as incoherent to the idea of God.
- The idea that "God exists" is an analytic statement is received from St Anselm.
- Perfect God creates perfectly (forces Descartes' to build a theodicy that humans must be perfect yet capable and the fault for error)
