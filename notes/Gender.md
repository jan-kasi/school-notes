## Some links between areas we studied in Core Theme

The question of the Core Theme is “what does it mean to be human”, so you can easily make the essay just about gender if you are able to frame the question nicely with the stimulus and leave space for nuance.

You can also bring this in as part of criticisms of other arguments or to build towards something

- This might be harder because you’ll probably have to plant this more than with some other ideas
- You also want to avoid throwing it in like an afterthought and not use it for the effective critical analysis

Here are some ideas you can link gender to:

### Freedom

If gender is determined (not free):

- This could be seen to limit freedom or—if gender is essence—may contradict some existentialist views, by being determined
- It might be useful for biological determinism and social determinism
- You can the effects this has for gender as a class
- Conversely, what it means if it is not
  - What does it make gender?
  - It might have implications for even more radical existentialism
  - You can also do class

If gender is determining (reduces possibility)

- Does gender determine some things about you (different to saying it is itself determined), if so this might have implications
- The role gender serves in hegemony then
- The influence of gender on freedom, you are not free to “do A actions, or be B thing” as the determining gender dictates
- Sexed bodies, sexualisation, language

The role of gender in society:

- Hegemony and patriarchy, as mentioned, also linking to freedom
- Power structures and domination
- Postcolonial analysis of gender

In individuals:

- Many of the previous points apply, you can also make them more about the individual, e.g. focus on the individual and gender with hegemony instead of the system

### Human nature

The obvious ones are if gender plays a role in some human nature. However, you can also link it to thinkers we have studied and to concepts.

Rationalism:

- There is feminist criticism of rationalism, in the CT textbook we have there is one of Plato
- You can discuss the implications of gender on rationality and traditionally associated ideas with it

Irrationality:

- You can view humans as irrational animals with gender too

- The relationship a unifying human nature might have with social ideas of gender, perhaps there is a link with the rational/irrational nature of humans, the aims of humans, etc., with the view you might hold of gender, or the institutions around gender

  Blank slate, gender comes in as a question here

Blank slate:

- Gender comes in very naturally, you can lead from blank slate or to blank slate (the better order will depend on your views on gender and tabula rasa)

The issues of ascribing a unifying human nature, or using it as justification, can be explored through gender:

- If it is anthropocentric or unhelpful, for example
- If it is based on assumptions of the thinker’s personal circumstances and applied everywhere
- If it is normative in the bad way Butler uses the word

If gender is a human thing, or non-humans might experience gender.

### Mind and Body

If gender is mind:

- Then you can discuss what makes the mind, and go to your theory of gender from there or to there
- You can think about gender essentialism
- You can talk about many of the theories
- If mind is malleable or not
- The nature of the mind through gender

If gender is body:

- Many of the previous things, only focusing on why it is not the mind, or if there is no mind, etc. and what distinguishes it
- You can come up with creative solutions to some contemporary issues which could be raised too
- You can do a lot with this

If gender is something else:

- You can begin to move away from just the mind-body dichotomy and introduce some third aspect which makes up humans (at least, perhaps, in our society), or some similar things
- This could be used for no-self theories as well

Nature of the mind and body can be viewed through gender too, if there is a fundamental difference, etc.

If the body and mind are gender*ed* or sex*ed* by things and are not so in vacuum, you can do some interesting things

### Self and Other

You can do some pretty obvious ones

You can bring in Derrida (if you are just built different like that):

- Othering
- Deconstructionism (because of dichotomies)

You can think about what theories of the self mean for gender

- Also the opposite

If gender is part of the self—be it essential, not, etc.—or not, and what it is then

You can link this back to many other core theme areas, with the effects which creating an Other and Self with gender categories

- e.g. Freedom, Mind/Body

### Identity

If gender is identity or not, etc. This one I think is pretty obvious, also we haven’t done too much on this.

### We aren’t doing philosophy of religion anymore but yeah that links too

You know that lesson we had. Yeah that one.

## Theory itself

Yay, the fun begins.

Gender theory and the analysis of gender in philosophy began to take hold faster as a feminist theory and area of study, and as a result of the movement towards new paradigms of understanding.

An important part of gender is to do with the distinction between sex and gender, similar in some ways to the mind/body distinction in its importance to the field.

One of the most influential works relevant to this is *The Second Sex*, by Simone de Beauvoir. It’s seen as a major work and the starting point for second-wave feminism by many. To understand the motivation behind the movement towards current terminology and theories, it is helpful to understand a little bit of context

### Context

#### The term “gender”

Previously, the word gender was usually used to describe *grammatical gender* in language, similar to case, often to do with nouns. The gender of the noun often had nothing to do with the noun itself, it was just something describing a grammatical quantity (there is some research in socio and psycholinguistics which explores the links between grammatical gender and thought, but I find it a tenuous point to hold unless done carefully so).

This is probably most familiar to you in Romance languages from Latin, for example for “le” and “la” in French, the 3 grammatical genders in Latin, and so on.

In the 1960s, psychology began to make a distinction between sex and gender:

- Sex was used to describe some biological part of a person
- Gender to describe an amount of masculinity or femininity a person exhibited

This was primarily done as a way to describe when someone’s sex and gender did not seem to match.

There were, however, two major reasons the sex/gender distinction took hold so fast (at least in some academic circles)

These 2 reasons were:

- Psychology
- Feminism

It is important to understand the reasons for the intial feminist acceptance of the distinction

#### Biological determinism

A major, if not the main, reason for the distinction was to combat the biological determinist stance that biology  destines a person. For the feminist, this was undesireable for a variety of reasons.

Here is a very nice example from an SEP article, which I found after writing all the notes.

> “A typical example…is that of Geddes and Thompson who, in 1889, argued that social, psychological and behavioural traits were caused by metabolic state. Women supposedly conserve energy (being ‘anabolic’) and this makes them passive, conservative, sluggish, stable and uninterested in politics. Men expend their surplus energy (being ‘katabolic’) and this makes them eager, energetic, passionate, variable and, thereby, interested in political and social matters. These biological ‘facts’ about metabolic states were used not only to explain behavioural differences between women and men but also to justify what our social and political arrangements ought to be. More specifically, they were used to argue for withholding from women political rights accorded to men because (according to Geddes and Thompson) “what was decided among the prehistoric Protozoa cannot be annulled by Act of Parliament” (quoted from Moi 1999, 18). It would be inappropriate to grant women political rights, as they are simply not suited to have those rights; it would also be futile since women (due to their biology) would simply not be interested in exercising their political rights.”

I hope it’s clear why people wanted to argue against it :neutral_face: 

A way to counter the position was to hold that behavioural and psychological differences had social causes. It was not that women were biologically incapable of political rights, the common traits observed were cultural products, not something which should be used in justification for determinism. While one can lead into social determinism, it is important to notice that regardless the emphasis has arguablt been shifted away from biology.

By doing this, one can hold the famous claim by de Beauvoir that one is not born, but rather *becomes* a woman. It is an effect of social discrimination which produces in people such profound effects that they appear to be caused by nature.

So, there is no claim to the biological determinist argument against women’s rights, as the arguments provided are not some immutable fact of nature, but a result of—hopefully—malleable society.

Many feminists absorbed the term “gender” into the terminology. Broadly:

- Sex describes biological features (like chromosomes, organs, hormones, etc.)
- Gender describes social factors (like social roles, behaviour, identity, etc.)

(This is later contested)

This allowed for discussion and differentiation between biological and psychological or social differences. Yay language!

By doing this, it became more possible to argue many differences between genders in society are just that, socially produced and *in society*, therefore changeable and not absolute.

Hopefully this gives some background for the original and some of the current aims and purposes of gender theory and the following.

As mentioned before, Beauvoir is important. I’ll be focusing on some specific parts of *The Second Sex*, obviously on gender, and hopefully make it nicely lead to the rest of this document. 

### The Second Sex

More context, because why not:

- Beauvoir was an existenitalist, femininst, and phenomenologist among many other wonderful things
- She challenged the philosophical tradition’s status quo
- She challenged the patriarchal status quo
- *The Second Sex* was the first instance where the gendered/sexed body was phenomenologically investigated

#### Okay now the work itself, here are some key parts:

The very famous quote:

> One is not born but becomes woman

This is a major point in defining the sex/gender distinction as massive. It can be contested if Beauvoir intended it to be so, followed it to its conclusions, or if the radical conclusions are justified, but it is certainly key in providing the previously mentioned language to discuss gender and current feminist debates and initiatig much discussion. This rejection of the typical biological stance can be traced to the phenomenological tradition: Beauvoir treats the assumptions as prejudices and does not accept them unless experience and embodied living validates it.

*The Second Sex* discusses the ways culture and society—including how the religious, literary, artistic, philosophical, scientific, and political traditions which are saturated in the world—create a world in which an ideology of the inferiority of women becomes seen as natural, and is used to justify a domination and patriarchy of inequality systems, and removes sexual differences to place the subject of the male and male body as the ideal and absolute, true, human being. CORE THEME LINKS WOW.

There was a dichotomy: women and men are either different or equal. Beauvoir challenges the idea, suggesting that men and women are equal but there is still a real difference.

- This can be traced to her phenomenological tradition: it would be against it to disregard the phenomenology of sexed bodies, and sexual difference, but also unjust and not very existentialist to suggest there was some fundamental inferiority.
- Further, it is unjust to use sexual differences as a justification for systems of inequality and subordination.
- This is a key point of second wave feminism

Beauvoir uses phenomenological analysis to draw the ideas of how culture and society frames women’s experience of their body and alienates them

- Think of the Marxist ideas of alienation and view how they are used here and the sociological theories of framed knowledge.
- Beauvoir is therefore able to use phenomenology as a device for liberation, and analyse the impact of gender as it is in society on people

##### The Other

Beauvoir uses the concept of the Other as a major driving force throughout. So there are plenty of links here, and also possibly to Derrida.

She bases it on the Hegelian idea of Other in the master-slave dialectic, but instead of those terms there is a “subject” and “other”.

- Subject is the absolute, master
- Other is the inessential

Those who are marked by Other are oppressed *as a group/class*

- Therefore find a shared history and situation to see themselves as part of the Other through.

Beauvoir doesn’t universalise this dialectic, she distinguishes the exploitation between Subjects and Others from the specific exploitation that Man as the Subject and Woman as the Other produces.

The man identifies as the absolute subject, as mentioned before, and quantifies Woman against this measure. Unsurprisingly this results in Woman being inferior, much like Hegel’s master-slave dialectic.

- These “inadequacies”, which in reality are not so, are then used to justify identifying Woman as the Other
- Due to this, there is the dispatching of unequal treatment and justification for subordination

Yet, in Hegelian master-slave dialectic, the slave is able to find the origin of Otherness and reestablish. 

For Beauvoir, the Woman as Other is unable to do find this origin in themselves. The origin of Otherness is not an origin, the reason for identification as Other is the use of the supposed inadequacy to *justify* the Othering of Woman, from the measure of *Man*.

So, while there is a shared experience, there is no way to use this bond of shared history to raise, as the slave does, and reestablish Woman as Subject.

Further, the Other is the inessential. There is no position set from which to rebel, the route to subjectivity and liberation can’t be the Hegelian way.

##### The flawed justification of Other

Beauvoir’s argument that the distinctions seen as inadequacies for justification of desubjectifying and Othering are not part of the woman herself can be seen as this:

- There are social and cultural assumptions about women and men’s bodies
- The differences between them are only inferior from a particular assumption and perspective
- Man defines the categories by which to judge based on himself, as Man identifies as the absolute subject, a measure for all (this can nicely tie in to anthropocentrism in other areas too too)
- For example: the justification that men should do certain things because they are the stronger sex
  - From where does the idea of strength apply? Because it is an assumed position
  - Identify strength as longevity, average body size, volume, density, ability to make decisive decisions, upper body strength, lower body strength, emotional resilience, emotional adaptability, etc. and the “stronger sex” changes
  - Why then, is it that we presuppose and pre-**set** the categories, it is like rigging the results of an election or a test, or using leading questions
  - This then links back to the subject and other dialectic, and the distinction between sex and gender:
    - The sex of woman is not the weaker sex, it is that the gender of woman is made to be weaker, and enforced thusly

##### Relevance today

It is still common to compare differences in sex and gender from the assumption and biased presuppositions of Man as Subject, and still common to identify biological differences as justifications.

### After de Beauvoir

The popularity of the distinction was mostly accepted throughout the second wave, then rejected more and more parts following.

The relationship between sex and gender continued to be discussed, and its implications for the aims of feminism and other issues.

I’ll now cover some of the theories and philosophy which ensured:

### Gender as social interpretation of sex

Originally, gender and sex continued to be thought to complement each other.

Gender was seen by many thinkers to be part of a *system*, Gyle Rubin even describes something termed the sex/gender system, a system used to shape the biological state of human sex through social intervention, and form Gender as “a socially imposed division of the sexes…a product of the social relations of sexuality”

This view of complementary sex and gender is sometimes summarised by “gender is the social interpretation of sex”.

- Our sexed bodies provide a base, they are the site on which gender is constructed onto
- Gender thought of as femininity and masculinity is placed onto the sexed body, differing how by the society and culture’s interpretation of how men and women should behave, and what it means to be that.
- This results in a social construction of gender differences based upon the ideas society interprets of sexed bodies

In this view, sex is fixed. The accepted standards of sexed bodies differ between cultures though, and they interpret the sexed body in different ways. This is what creates feminine and masculine people. 

Distinguishing sex and gender also allows the two to come apart, in this view, a body sexed one way can be gendered in another way. The extent of this varies between thinkers though

### Gender as socially constructed

It follows, then, that perhaps gender is socially constructed.

I found three common ways to read and interpret/apply Beauvoir’s statement:

- gender as sexuality
- gender socialisation
- gender as personality

#### Gender as the feminine and masculine sexuality

This view is mainly developed and put forward by Catherine MacKinnon

It is quite complicated, I find. There are so many ways to link this to various things however, so I think it would be worth it if you are interested. Immediately you might see some links to Derrida, Foucault, and contemporary ideas.

It is also particularly relevant in current times, I found some of the testimonies in everyonesinvited to resonate deeply with at least parts of her ideas.

Here is a ~~crude~~ summary:

The social interpretation of sex, gender, is created by sexual objectification of women.

- Women are seen as objects *for* men’s sexual satisfaction
- Women are treated as such

Masculinity is defined in society as sexual domination of the female, and femininity is defined as sexual submissiveness.

- This might seem even more applicable when one considers how often non heteronormative sexualities or relationships which deviate from this pattern are viewed in society
- This also seems to be the conditioned position for many

For MacKinnon, gender is constructed in constituent parts: we refer to social factors to define it. Mainly, this is done by comparison to the position in the dynamic relationship of sexualised dominance and submissiveness.

Because the two define each other in this way, gender is inherently a hierarchical system. Furthermore, the hierarchical system is tied to *power relations*. “Oh hello, Foucault and friends, come on in.”

For MacKinnon, the idea of gender equality then makes no sense, as gender is constructed in a fundamentally oppressive and hierarchical way.

There are several parts to this

| Sexuality                                                    | Gender                                                       | Result                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| If sexuality ceases to be hierarchical and dominant,         | and gender remains the same                                  | The hierarchical genders would no longer exist.              |
| If sexuality ceases to be hierarchical and dominant,         | and gender changes to be non-hierarchically constructed in this way, or is imagined culturally and no longer defined in terms of sexuality | Those genders defined through sexuality would no longer exist, but there might be a new imagining of gender |
| If it continues                                              | Gender changes                                               | This would really depend what it changes too, but it is incredibly likely that it is impossible to rethink gender without some form of change. |
| Changes                                                      | Changes                                                      | This would really depend                                     |
| However, for MacKinnon, this is unlikely to change, because of underlying power inequalities | This too is unlikely to change because of underlying power inequalities | The equality of genders is sadly nonsensical, and cannot be changed (at least in this society, with the current power expressions) |

However, men are not “naturally” predisposed to objectify, and women to be submissive. MacKinnon holds that these sexualities are socially conditioned (this is where more contemporary themes apply). However, the socialised and learnt differences in behaviour, traits, etc. are not responsible for the power inequality.

Men have been conditioned to find subordination to be feminine and attractive, and this pushes and conditions onto women a male-centred view of what female sexuality should be. This conditioning enforces the sexuality, which informs the view of femininity and masculinity, which is what is pushed onto the base of the sexed body to define the gender of people.

MacKinnon uses the example of pornography as a conditioning tool

- pornography shows a false idea of what sexuality is and of what women desire, suggesting to the one conditioned that it truly is the nature of women to be submissive and want to be, conditioning men to the first point
- Male dominance then enforces this view onto the ideas of gender and sexuality onto women and men
- This dominance isn’t the result of the conditioning though. The socialisation is a result of underlying power inequalities
- This then links to social policy change, MacKinnon argues that restrictions on pornography are vital to ending the status of women as subordinate to men

The underlying power inequalities is quite a challenging idea to explain clearly and concisely in a short essay, so it might be beneficial to eloquently and convincingly dance around it if it isn’t necessary for your essay.

#### Gender socialisation

Another way to interpret Beauvoir. Masculinity and femininity are products of nurturing—how you are brought up and socialised. You are socialised to become a woman or a man through a process of socialisation where you acquire traits and learn behaviour.

The social interpretation of sex is constructed onto people by socialisation.

Gender differences are therefore cultural rather than biological, and stem from a collection of the family, peers, culture’s, etc., views on sexed bodies and gender, specifically gender norms.

There is an abundance of was people are socialised as a gender, and most also hold that this process is also done in observing the world. So, even just the structure of society, with all its gender norms, socialises people to “learn” a gender.

Because the roles are learned, they can also be unlearned. However, because it is so prevalent, it is very difficult to do this. While the aim should be to remove norms and unlearn norms to create more equal society, this is incredibly hard to do. There have been many papers about socialisation into genders, and many thinkers, so go have fun finding hundreds of ideas.

#### Gender as the feminine and masculine personality

This is mainly advocated for by Nancy Chodorow, who criticises social learning theory as overly simplistic to explain gender differences. Some appear to be more fundamental differences in the ego’s definition and identity.

Chodorow’s position has ties to Freudian psychoanalytic theory and similar strains of thought, but it is quite different.

Chodorow argues that gender is a personality which is developed in early childhood due to parenting practices. Because it is the social norm that women (usually the mother) look after a child, gendered personalities develop in response to this. The relationship between a mother and son and mother and daughter will be different because of identification.

- Chodorow proposes that the caretaker will identify with the daughter more than the son, unconsciously pushing the son to develop a more psychologically individual personality to the mother—leading to more defined boundaries of the son’s ego
- The daughter will be prompted to develop more flexible boundaries in ego

- These gendered personalities are expressed in common, stereotypical, gendered behaviour
- This could be perhaps observed in how some children and adults do act in different ways depending on their resemblance to their mother, and how trying to define oneself outside of either parent’s identity often involves acting out in a non-conforming way

Chodorow continues that these gender differences in personality and behaviour are able to be changed, and should be. She argues they hold a key role in women’s oppression by altering personality to be overly attentive or detached, or overly submissive or dominant, for example.

To change this, better parenting with both masculine and feminine personalities would help develop more balanced gendered personality. While this seems like the simplest solution of the three I’ve mentioned, and it does seem superficially the case that the relationship to the parent during child growth alters the expression of gender and a personality, I find it has some worrying implications.

Primarily, that of perhaps enforcing a more traditional family unit, or being possibly used to argue for an even more normative and prescriptive idea of gender. For example, single parents or non-heterosexual parents. Further, there have been quite a few studies on the effects of being raised in a non-heterosexual household compared to a heterosexual nuclear family unit, and there was no discrepancy between gender or sexuality between the two. In some cases, it was better for the child in the non-traditional household. Perhaps this is for other reasons, of course, but it is a fair point to keep in mind. Furthermore, perhaps Chodorow mistakes the personality of parenting with an overall environment one grows up in. However, the gender realist foundation somewhat insulates Chodorow’s position; not however, sufficiently, in my view.

### Problems with the sex/gender distinction

This is where things become more interesting.

Every previously mentioned position shares a metaphysical foundation: gender realism. That’s the position that a given gender shares some defining feature, which means *all* women differ from *all* men or *all* gender *x* through this feature. An example for each:

- MacKinnon hold sexual objectification as something women share
- Socialisation theory holds that genders share a set of acquired behaviours and traits, and the process of being socialised into their gender
- Chodorow holds the personality as something all members of the gender share
- and so on

With the position of gender realism, it is not the case that pointing out an outlier or example disproves the point. If one does not fit that feature, then one does not count as *x* gender. Otherwise, of course, it would be quite a lot simpler to counterexample.

It is possible to counter the views individually, and reject each detail. However, it might be much more effective to simply critique and object to the metaphysical foundations.

#### Particularity

Elizabeth Spelman argues against gender realism with her particularity argument. This has close ties to intersectionality and related areas.

- Gender realists disregard the construction of gender as intersecting with other social orders, such as race and class

- For gender realism to hold gender must be separate and independently constructed but this is not the case, if it was then everyone of a gender would experience that the same way

- This fails to take into account the background of the world, that people’s circumstances change their experience of gender

- The initial gender realists assumed all women shared some part of what it means to be a woman, and that this was the same for all women regardless of circumstance

- For some, they go too far in applying their experience to everyone

- Spelman’s critique continues that white, Western, middle-class feminists thought of the shared features as simply reflecting on the cultural features conditioning their gender, and so ended up arguing that:

  > “the womanness underneath the Black woman’s skin is a white woman’s, and deep down inside the Latina woman is an Anglo woman waiting to burst through an obscuring cultural shroud”

- By doing this, the particular brand of feminist makes the condition of one group a metaphysical normative truth, which marginalises some and privileges others

  - This is a great criticism, it undermines the metaphysical framework, undermines the argument as assumptions, and undermines the purpose of the argument as a failure which perhaps even contributes towards what it aims to prevent

  

There are some who hold the intersectional analytical implications of the particularity argument as removing gender realism as a possibility.

Others hold that it does not prove the impossibility of a shared characteristic or unifying feature, only the impossibility that it be *certain* characteristics and some ways of attempting to discover it are misguided and harmful.

#### Usefulness

Some hold that the distinction is not helpful or useful, for the previous reasons, some which will be later covered, and some now.

The distinction could be criticised as displaying a problematic dichotomy and form of thinking that ironically undercuts the aims of the feminist project:

- the distinction can be seen as replicating the distinctions between mind/body, culture/nature, civilisation/savagery, etc., which have often been used to justify oppression of groups

In terms of Derrida, his theory of Deconstruction could be applied to analyse these created dichotomies.

Often, one of the items is valued over the other. By distinguishing sex and gender, it could be the case that one is valued less and considered inferior, or objectified. This can be observed with the androcentric views of mind and body, with often a designation of men as reason and women as body. Further, the inferior sibling of the dichotomy is often attributed to a gender.

Further, it can be argued that the distinction has some underlying issues. One such issue is it appears to imply gender is a mind-dependant thing as it is socially constructed. Politically, this tends to devalue it. Practically too, it may be taken to imply that changing some social practices and thoughts will change the ideas of gender, while this is not the case.

It’s also the case that claiming gender is a result of oppressive forces suggests we should remove gender entirely, which some understandably feel strongly against. Some could argue that this is removing something which shouldn’t, or attempting to remove a structure instead of perhaps addressing similar fundamental issues which might improve it.

### Judith Butler

Butler is very well known and influential, as well as controversial. Many of her ideas are commonly misinterpreted.

Initially I will discuss Butler’s challenge to the gender realist position:

#### Normativity

The Normativity Argument is directed towards the political sibling of gender realism, identity politics.

Identity politics is, roughly, political organisation based on being a member of some group. This membership is obtained by shared common experiences, features, conditions, etc. Mostly, these groups are to do with race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, culture, etc.

Butler also makes a claim similar to Spelman, ideas of unifying gender fail to account for differences between gender and the intersectionality and multiplicity of the “array” of constructed woman.

The feminist gender realist attempts to remove the biologically determinist stance of what it means to be a woman or a gender, but end up producing new accounts of some flawed idea of shared characteristic.

The second claim is that these false accounts are *normative*.

- They define the term woman in a way implying there is a correct way to be gendered woman
- This definition marginalises and privileges
- It also follows to legitimise and condemn certain actions and experiences
- It can be used to argue that there is such a type of woman which feminism should be concerned with, instead of everyone
- From Chodorow it might be taken to follow that “real women” exhibit a feminine personality, so this is what should be concerned with and addressed, those who are not exhibiting the particular personality do not fit the normative definition, thus they are excluded
- For MacKinnon and socialisation it similarly follows

Butler hold a claim that identity categories are never descriptive but always normative, they determine and prescribe norms and standards instead of describing an identity. This normative nature means they are inherently exclusionary.

- Butler holds that such identity terms as “woman” can never be used in non-ideological ways
- These terms always encode information and conditions which not everyone who should fit the category satisfies
- The exercise of forming a distinction between categories is a normative and evaluative commitment, which is performed with power by those socially powerful

#### Performativity

Context:

- Performativity is the function of language to act as a form of social action and be an effect. Originally it was described by John Austin, for the capability language has to fulfil an action by its use.
  - For example, saying “I promise” effects a social action and change, and fulfils the action just by being said

- This is something we briefly covered in philosophy of religious language with DZ Phillips, if you recall.

- It has applications in many fields

Butler’s theory of gender performativity holds that:

- There is no essential property to gender
- Gender is an illusion of performance maintained by power structures

Gender is socially constructed through a performance of performative actions and speech. These serve to build and maintain certain identities.

Traditionally, feminist accounts of gendered bodied suppose there are essential properties by which one is a gender. This results in normative claims:

- women are x y and z with a, men are b c d with w, etc.

These normative claims are like sequences which one has to “coherently” fulfil. Social pressures determine individuals who deviate from the normative claim as “doing” their gender incorrectly, or similar. These gender non conforming actions are discouraged to various different levels in different ways.

This links to the particularity argument and the first part of Butler’s argument, that the defining of gender reflects the conditions of socially powerful and privileged individuals, and marginalises those who do not fit to this idea.

However, if gender is performative, then there are no such essential properties to attribute to the normative claim. The performative actions and discourse of gender creates gender itself as an illusion, much like a promise or similar. 

There is no *expression* of being a gender, it is that gender is instituted *by* the actions deemed expressions. For MacKinnon, for example, it might be applied to: the dominance and submission is not some essential property built onto a sexed body making gender express itself in this way, it is the actions which make the body gendered and only the actions are there

Gender in this way is something one does, not something one is or believes. Similarly to the theory of the performative language games of religion in its arguments.

The repetition of the acts into habits and further continually build into identity and interacts with it, creating an illusion that it is the backwards way and not something done.

The traditional social schemes of gender fail to describe the state of affairs, or represent things as they are. The scheme only serves to be determined by social factors on how we use it, generating certain actions to be performed as gender.

The aim should be to remove the norms which pressure acting in gendering ways for Butler.

#### The non-distinction between sex and gender

For Butler, both gender and sex are socially constructed

- Sexed bodies are also performative, there is no ontology of the body separate from the actions
- Similarly in some ways to Beauvoir’s proposition that sex differences are presupposed and of the Other, Butler holds that the bodies we view as the material base for gender are *themselves constructed* **as if** they provide these foundation.
- The performance and cultural views of gender permeate even to the level in which they affect the thing where they are supposedly established from, the sexed body

Therefore, sexed bodies never exist outside of social understanding, and our understanding of gender directly shapes how we culturally understand sex. The previous view that the body is some empty vessel on which to put gender on is challenged: the sexed body is constructed in a discourse.

This means that sex assignment, too, is normative. The famous example is of a doctor proclaiming a newborn is a boy or girl, the doctor doesn’t make a descriptive claim but a normative claim, making the child into what is performatively proclaimed.

As previously, the habitual performances become imprinted as if they are natural and essence, where they are not in truth at all.

It is important to clarify that this does not mean physical body doesn’t exist. It means that understanding of the sexed body is a product of social conditioning and performance.

Butler makes the claim hat sex *is* gender, therefore. Though some have noted it is perhaps more accurate to pronounce that claims about sex imply gender norms. As you may notice, this has come quite close to Beauvoir but with a fundamental difference of the distinction.

### On the classification of sex

Recently, aside from Butler, it has been argued that sex classification isn’t a just a matter of biology.

If you think of the secondary sex characteristics and biological or physical features frequently associated with sexes, these can easily be affected by social practices. Immediate examples include different nutrition, exercise, etc.

For those of you who do biology, epigenetics is applicable here. It might not even be the case that the genetic code of a person is purely classified biologically without social input, as environmental factors can cause changes in genetic expression and gene silencing. If one accepts evolutionary theory and the epigenetic impact, then it could be the case that the classification and differences in sex are more so a result of social and cultural factors, and that social conditioning quite literally shapes our biology.

Further, the idea of not constructing objects such as body, but the concepts themselves.

What we understand as sex is shaped by social meaning. The understanding of sex being chromosomal is fairly recent, previously it would have been a matter of biology but not the same, and so on. Therefore it might not purely be a biological distinction.

Further, the lines drawn between the social ideas of sex, which many in the current scientific paradigm hold as immutable distinctions, are blurred. Around 1.7% of the population do not fit into the neatly drawn boxes for sex by society, “male” and “female”. This is a significant amount, and not at all outlier cases to be disregarded in any case.

Sex classification becomes much more complex, and begins to look more like a spectrum or cluster or “features”.

From these blurred distinctions, Butler bases her move towards the performative construction of sexed body.

## Okay that’s it, I will leave out the rest for now. If you are interested you can do your own research

I’ve done too much and yet not enough.

Here are some ways to link more “contemporary” issues to gender theory:

Transgender people and all that goes along with it:

- You can use a friendly radical acceptance of trans people as a criticism for the implications of certain gender theories
  - Also as a way to critically analyse ***towards*** a personal philosophical position instead of just evaluating and appraising individual arguments from other people
- You can discuss the implications gender theory might have for trans people (I would suggest focusing on the political implications, because trying to explain someone’s gender, identity, and problems away is…problematic and not great, to say the least. If you want to go down that route, you’ll need to avoid the problem of particularity and try to be clever about it)
- You can do the opposite, ~~though I would quickly begin to lose respect for you and it would be an impressive recovery to regain even a little bit back~~ though you will need to contend with lots of criticism of particularity, and some fallacies which several thinkers have pointed out. Go do your research on this if you really want to

Gender non conformity:

- You can view how theories apply to this, and how this impacts gender theories

Systematic sexualisation and the rest along with it

- This is a very prevalent issue which you also need to be careful with, but you can very nicely analyse the effects which some ways of thinking lead to, or how they deal with this
- You can bring in even more relevance with the everyonesinvited movement, etc.

On the changing public views of feminism:

- There seems to be a move towards certain exclusionary people being associated as the majority of feminism, particularly on issues such as transgender rights, intersectionality, etc., where the public media frames the issues as “minority vs feminists”. This is unhelpful for hopefully clear reasons, and largely false.
- There is a move back towards gender essentialism and realism, especially towards biological determinism of gender and through gender

You could do a lot, but now I’ll actually stop typing.
