# 25 M3 Contingency argument
## Contingency argument
p38-39
1. If I caused my existence, I would have all perfections
2. I do not have all perfections (finite substance)
3. Therefore, I am not the cause of my existence

no imperfections -> me
not no imperfections
therefore not me

2 is a posteriori

NB: for IB, causal argument = trademark + contingency argument
(some scholars will talk about the Causal Argument as only the Trademark Argument, but the IB is clear that for Paper 2 it is both Trademark and Contingency)

p39("I do not escape...) 2 par.

1. The same power is needed to create and preserve
2. If I have always existed I or something else must have this power
3. If I had this power I would know (premiss about clarity about mind)
4. I don't know that I have this power
5. I do not have this power
6. I depend on an external being for my existence

Distinction between creation and preservation is a conceptual human error
"a lifespan can be divided into countless parts, each completely independent of the others"

1. A lifespan is composed of individual parts , such that existing at one point does not entail or cause my existing later
2. Therefore, some cause is needed to keep me in existence. My existence is not uncaused
3. I do not have the power to cause my continued existence through time
4. Therefore I depend on something else to exist

p39("But perhaps this being...") 2 par
1. There must be at least as much reality in the cause as the effect (Levels of Reality).
2. I am a thinking thing possessing the idea of God
3. Whatever caused me must be a thinking thing possessing the idea of God
4. If this cause exists from itself, then it has the power to exist through itself and so possesses all the attributes of the idea of God (i.e. it is God)
5. If it exists by something else, then that something must either cause itself or by another thing (both possessing the idea of God)
6. An infinite regress is not possible as it is not only what has caused something, but also what is preserving/allowing something to exist
7. Therefore there must be a cause of its own existence with all the attributes of God, i.e. is God.

i.e.
1. Either what caused me is the cause of its own existence (infinite substance) or is caused by another cause (finite substance) [levels of reality]
2. If its existence is by another cause, then its cause is in turn either the cause of its own existence or caused by another cause [Aristotelian efficient cause]
3. There cannot be an infinite regress of causes
4. Therefore some cause must be the cause of its own existence
5. What is the cause of its own existence (so mine) is God.
