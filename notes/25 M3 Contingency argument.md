# 25 M3 Contingency argument
## Contingency argument
Distinction between creation and preservation is a conceptual human error
"a lifespan can be divided into countless parts, each completely independent of the others"

1. A lifespan is composed of individual parts , such that existing at one point does not entail or cause my existing later
2. Therefore, some cause is needed to keep me in existence. My existence is not uncaused
3. I do not have the power to cause my continued existence through time
4. Therefore I depend on something else to exist


## p39("But perhaps this being...") 2 par
1. There must be at least as much reality in the cause as the effect (Levels of Reality).
2. I am a thinking thing possessing the idea of God
3. Whatever caused me must be a thinking thing possessing the idea of God
4. If this cause exists from itself, then it has the power to exist through itself and so possesses all the attributes of the idea of God (i.e. it is God)
5. If it exists by something else, then that something must either cause itself or by another thing (both possessing the idea of God)
6. An infinite regress is not possible as it is not only what has caused something, but also what is preserving/allowing something to exist
7. Therefore there must be a cause of its own existence with all the attributes of God, i.e. is God.

i.e.
1. Either what caused me is the cause of its own existence (infinite substance) or is caused by another cause (finite substance) [levels of reality]
2. If its existence is by another cause, then its cause is in turn either the cause of its own existence or caused by another cause [Aristotelian efficient cause]
3. There cannot be an infinite regress of causes
4. Therefore some cause must be the cause of its own existence
5. What is the cause of its own existence (so mine) is God.

## Causal argument = contingency + trademark
1. Causal Adequacy Principle (a posteriori), how it applies to ideas.
- "there is at least as much reality in the efficient and total cause as in its effect" (Causal adequacy)
- this applies to ideas because they cannot come from nothing, as they are something (innate, adventitious, and factious all come from "something")
2. Trademark
- "something something I find within me the idea of the infinite..."
- idea of the infinite, but I am a finite being because I have imperfections. If I was infinite I wouldn't therefore I'm not the cause of my own existence nor of this idea.
- Idea of the infinite must come from something infinite, God. Therefore infinite idea is a trademark God placed within me.
3. Contingency
- "a lifespan can be divided into countless parts, each completely independent of the others", existence at one point doesn't entail existence at another point. There must be something preserving my existence.
- Preservation and creation are the same power
- As I cannot and have not created myself, I cannot preserve myself (refer to 2, I am not infinite), therefore I am reliant on something else to preserve me.
- Whatever caused me must have an idea of the infinite, i.e. it *is* the infinite or it is finite with infinite idea.
- If I am caused by a finite thing, with the idea of the infinite, it must be caused by something else with the idea of infinite.
- There cannot be an infinite regress, so there must be an infinite causer (with attributes of God, therefore God) (which caused its own existence Causal Adequacy).
- Ultimately I am caused and preserved by God.

### mini summary
p38-39

1. I have an idea of the infinite.
2. It cannot come from me as I would have to be perfect/ be the infinite, which I am not.
3. Trademark progresses to God put idea of infinite in me.
4. I am not the cause of my own existence.
5. The thing which caused me must be God
6. I have an idea placed in me of God, who is the thing which caused and preserves me.

no imperfections -> me
not no imperfections
therefore not me


NB: for IB, causal argument = trademark + contingency argument
(some scholars will talk about the Causal Argument as only the Trademark Argument, but the IB is clear that for Paper 2 it is both Trademark and Contingency)

p39("I do not escape...) 2 par.

1. The same power is needed to create and preserve
2. If I have always existed I or something else must have this power
3. If I had this power I would know (premiss about clarity about mind)
4. I don't know that I have this power
5. I do not have this power
6. I depend on an external being for my existence
