# I Go Back to May 1937
## Sharon Olds
```
I see them standing at the formal gates of their colleges,
I see my father strolling out
under the ochre sandstone arch, the   
red tiles glinting like bent
plates of blood behind his head, I
see my mother with a few light books at her hip
standing at the pillar made of tiny bricks,
the wrought-iron gate still open behind her, its
sword-tips aglow in the May air,
they are about to graduate, they are about to get married,   
they are kids, they are dumb, all they know is they are   
innocent, they would never hurt anybody.   
I want to go up to them and say Stop,   
don’t do it—she’s the wrong woman,   
he’s the wrong man, you are going to do things
you cannot imagine you would ever do,   
you are going to do bad things to children,
you are going to suffer in ways you have not heard of,
you are going to want to die. I want to go
up to them there in the late May sunlight and say it,
her hungry pretty face turning to me,   
her pitiful beautiful untouched body,
his arrogant handsome face turning to me,   
his pitiful beautiful untouched body,   
but I don’t do it. I want to live. I   
take them up like the male and female   
paper dolls and bang them together   
at the hips, like chips of flint, as if to   
strike sparks from them, I say
Do what you are going to do, and I will tell about it.
```
## Analysis

The first 4 lines have a mood of grandeur and build an atmosphere of a polished summer memory.
Strong unease at line 5.
Voice is conflicted, wants to be able to stop suffering but can't because she is alive and because she wants to be.

"I | take them up like male and female paper dolls and bang them together | at the hips, like chips of flint"

- perhaps she is doing this because it is the idea of having her which made them have her, she feels like the cause of the problems even though she can’t do anything.



1. Sum up the speaker’s attitude in one or two words. Identify specific words or phrases from the poem which reflect this attitude. 
   - Helplessness?  Trying to be assertive and in control, but isn’t.
2. What sort of mood or atmosphere is created by the speaker’s tone? In other words, how do you, as the reader, feel when reading the poem? 
   - Desperation in the narrator’s voice, she needs to change it. But also hopelessness because she knows whats going to happen and it already has, there is no changing it. She feels like she is the cause of it. Conflicted, she wants to live but also doesn’t want to.
3. How does repetition reinforce tone or mood? 
   - “I see… | I see…” anaphora, she can only see? -> helpless
   - “you are going to”, hopeless that this is *going* to happen, future tense, but also an active imperative so she feels responsible for it
   - pronouns
