# Benevolence

Different understandings of evil.

No coherent understanding of what evil is.





McCabe

- Badness is a mirage of emergent effects of different properties, it is not a property in itself.

- God could have made a perfect world, but it is not the best possible world *for us*.
  - Pain exists because it must exist.
  - Free will is a greater good than moral evil is a bad.
- Doing evil diminishes one’s humanity.
- God is not responsible for our moral evil.
  - God is not guilty by neglect.

- God is under no obligation.
  - NoG.
  - Asymmetrical relationship (Aquinas & book of Job).
- God gives us the ***gift*** of free will.
  - WE are responsible for evil, not God.
    - God is only responsible for giving us this world, nothing more. Furthermore, God is not under any obligation to us.





best possible world

- looks at god’s wisdom, not god’s benevolence.
