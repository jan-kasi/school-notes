# Kant's Moral Philosophy

—Presentation by Sami

—Notes by me, nahla

**Framework for Kant’s moral philosophy**

- Basically all of it, but especially *Groundworks for the metaphysics of morals* and *The Critique of Pure Reason*

Kant is trying to find an a priori nature (synthetic a priori for morality)

Focuses on the question of what one should do

Means to challenge the moral sceptics who believe we are not bound to moral duty

Trying to establish a “complete” philosophy

Noumenal and Phenomenal



Colonial and sexist basis on his philosophy

Extensively writes about how this only applies to white men.

## Where does morality come from?

The Good Will



- We can only be free and autonomous if morality isnt an illusion
- Formula for the law of nature: “So act as to treat humanity, wheter in your own person or in another, always as an end and never only as a means”

- Formula for the End itself
- Formula of autonomy
- Formula of the Kingdoms of Ends
- The Categorical Imperative
- Moral duty: perfect vs imperfect 

## 1. Will and Duty

the “Good Will” and “duty”

Application to his political philosophy, Kantian universal law: each person has a right so long as it does not contradict someone else

good will and action are predicated on rationality, which is a priori for Kant

- This anchors objectivity to action and good will, will and morality planted within rationality

Free will and autonomy are predicated of humans on the existence of ethics and moral law

- i.e. if we are not ethics and moral law are an illusion then we cannot be free or autonomous

Kant wants to deduce moral philosophy and ethics via a priori means.

- Not based on the experience of humans and behaviour but on fundamental laws

- Not about emotion, counter to Hume RIAOTBTSOTP

The only thing that is good is Good Will



Logic of illusion
