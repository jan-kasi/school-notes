# Eternal

## Definition

“Eternity” has been used in many ways to describe the relationship God has to time. There are two main views:

- Divine temporality
- Divine timelessness

|                       | Divine temporality                                           | Divine timelessness                                          |
| --------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sometimes called:** | everlasting.                                                 | timeless.                                                    |
|          **Briefly:** | God exists in time (temporal).                               | God exists outside of time (atemporal).                      |
|        **Positions:** |                                                              |                                                              |
|                       | Pure Temporalism<br />God is located in all times. God is temporal like humans, except the temporal extent for God is infinite. God never came into and will never go out of existence | Pure Atemporalism<br />God is not in time and has no temporal properties. |
|                       | Relative timelessness<br />There are two times: Measured time (human), Ontological time (God). God is timeless relative to Measured time simply by transcending ours. God is still temporal in Ontological time. | Temporal Duration (ET’)<br />God contains all life and this life has a non temporal duration. God is simultaneously temporal and eternal. |
|                       | Temporal with creation<br />God is timeless without creation (before) and temporal with creation (after). God does not become temporal, he simply is with creation and not without. There is no time before creation. | Temporal  Duration (QTE)<br />The timeless duration of God has distinct moments in succession. These are in succession but not temporally so. |
|                       | Metrically Amorphous Time<br />Before creation God lives in a time which lacks metric definition (it cannot be measured. Swinburne calls this “metrically amorphous time”). After creation, time acquires a metric by God placing laws of nature. | Timelessness with no Duration<br />Timelessness has no duration. God can know the whole sequence of temporal events non-sequentially. |

## Application

At first, how God is eternal might not seem particularly important to other properties of God or God in general.

However, if the premise of God as the creator of the entire universe is taken:

- There must be some way that God relates to the **creation**
  - There must be some way that God relates to the things inside the creation, i.e. humans, events, things.
- There must be some way God relates to the **structure of the universe**
  - Did God create time and space as well?
  - How/from where did God create these things (inside time, outside it, something else, etc.)?

Furthermore:

- After the creation, from where does God act?
- After the creation, where and how does God exist in time (if at all)?
- Does God experience time before/after creation?
  - If not: how do events caused by God/actions of God take place?
  - If so: how does this affect the knowledge of God?
- How does the existence of God in time affect human free will?
- Is time the same for God and humans?

## Divine Timelessness

### Boethius

Boethius views eternity as the **simultaneous and complete** possession of all life in an **illimitable** way:

- > “Eternity […] is the whole, simultaneous, and perfect possession of boundless life”

  (Boethius *Consolation*, V.VI., transl. Stewart et al. 1973)

- > “It is the common judgement, then, of all creatures that live by reason that God is eternal. So let us consider the nature of eternity, for this will make clear to us both the nature of God and his manner of knowing. Eternity, then, is the complete, simultaneous and perfect possession of everlasting life; this will be clear from a comparison with creatures that exist in time.
  >
  > …for it is one thing to progress like the world in Plato’s theory through everlasting life, and another thing to have embraced the whole of everlasting life in one simultaneous present.”

  (Boethius, *Consolation*, V.VI., transl. V. E. Watts 1969)

  

- God experiences his whole existence simultaneously, perfectly, and in an illimitable way

- God exists in a **timeless eternity**:

  - How a point at the centre of a circle has the same relation to any point to the circumference is how God’s existence in timeless eternity is related to time

- The vision/foreknowledge of God is like how someone on the top of a hill can glance back/down and see everyone **at once** below them



### Problems:

- Solution to prescience limiting or infringing mental free acts undermined by Boethius’ later claim that God is still the determining force of all things
- How can God act temporally while remaining atemporal/timeless?

***

### Aquinas

- > *“we cannot know in what God's essence consists, but solely in what it does not consist”*

  (Aquinas *Summa Theologica*, I-II. Q2. II. ad. 2, transl. Fathers of the English Dominican Province, 1947)

Aquinas argues that God is not in time.

- Aquinas defines time as: *a measurement of change with respect to before and after*
- Aquinas thinks time is not entirely mind-independent (as it is a measurement) and exists only if there is something to change.
- If something does not change it is not measured by time, therefore it does not exist in time
- God is metaphysically **simple**—Aquinas means that God is not made of parts, substance, or accidental forms
- God is **unchanging** and **immutable** (unchangeable)
- Because God doesn’t change, God is not measured by time. This means **God does not exist in time**

Aquinas’ overall argument in premise form:

1. If something is metaphysically simple, it is not composed of parts.
2. Whatever has parts has a cause of its existence: something puts it together or is caused to exit.
3. Nothing can cause itself to exit all by itself.
4. Therefore, by (1) and (2), whatever has parts has its existence caused by another.
5. God is the first uncaused cause, God does not have his existence caused by another.
6. Therefore, God is not composed of parts, he is metaphysically simple.
7. Material objects are composed of substance and accidental forms. These explain why that object remains the same through time an change. Substance remains the same but can gain and lose accidental forms—characteristics a substance can gain/lose while remaining the same.
8. At any moment, an object is composed of its substance and a set of accidental forms.
9. For something to change, it has a feature which it doesn’t at another time.
10. Therefore a being which changes is composed of substance and accidental forms, by (7), (8) and (9).
11. As God is simple (not composed of parts), god is not a composite of substance and accidental forms, by (6) and (10).
12. Therefore, God is unchanging (does not change), by (10) and (11).
13. If God *can/could* change, he has features he can gain or lose without going out of existence—accidental forms.
14. If God can change this would mean he is composed of substance and accidents.
15. Therefore God is immutable (unchangeable), by (6), (13) and (14)
16. Time is a measurement of change with respect to before and after.
17. Therefore, if something does not change it is not measured by time, that is, does not exist in time.
18. By (12), (15) and (17), God does not exist in time. i.e. God is timeless.

As everything after God is caused, God is the only simple being in existence. Aquinas thinks this makes God even more unlike the things he creates. So we cannot compare God to anything to form a phantasm with sense perception to abstract something to compare with God and  therefore know what God is. Therefore God is transcendent.

Timeless eternity is part of the language for talking meaningfully about God:

- It is meaningless to ask how long God has existed, or what he will do, or when he will do something

#### Problems:

- Premise of simplicity depends on acceptance of First Uncaused Cause argument
- How can God act temporally if he is atemporal?
  - Can God remain atemporal by doing this?

- Timelessness of God dependant on accepting Aquinas’ definition of time as measurement of change
  - And as mind-dependant
- Also dependant on Aquinas’ theories of accidental forms and substance

###  Stump & Kretzmann

Stump and Kretzmann take from Boethius’ standard definition of what an eternal being is and extract 4 points:

1. Any timeless being has life

2. This life cannot be limited
   - This involves a special type of “**atemporal duration**”:
3. Anything which has life must have some duration

4. A timeless being possesses all it’s life at once (doesn’t experience or involve succession)

- Coined idea of Eternal-Temporal-simultaneity to demonstrate how an eternal being’s life’s events are simultaneous with each other and temporal items
  - There are two modes of existence: one temporal, one atemporal
  - These are simultaneous for observers on different modes

Analogy:

- Two parallel horizontal lines: lower line represents time, upper represents timeless eternity. 
- Presentness is represented by light
  - The temporal present is represented by a light that moves steadily along the lower line
  - The eternal present is represented by the upper line being lit all at once
- Each dot in the lower line, when it is temporally present, is ET-simultaneous with the whole of the upper line from the viewpoint of that time.
- From the viewpoint of eternity, the entire lower line is lit up. Each time is ET-simultaneous with the whole upper line while it is temporally present

#### Problems:

- How can something atemporal have a **duration**?
- Why must there be a duration?
- How can an atemporal observer view something temporal and vice versa?
  - Even if we suppose an atemporal observer sees something temporal, doesn’t this observation come to be?
  - Doesn’t this now make the being temporal?
  - How can a temporal being observe an atemporal or eternal something without **bringing** it into temporal being?
- Delmas Lewis argues that a temporal being can only observe a temporal thing, an atemporal being can only observe atemporal things. This observation cannot cross the divide between temporal and timeless
- The obscure use of “reference frame” is unclear in the paper

## Divine Temporality

### Padgett

- > “I have not abandoned timelessness. Instead, I have redefined ‘God is timeless’ to mean that God is relatively timeless, i.e. he is not measured by time nor is he affected by the negative aspects of temporal passage.”

  ​	(Padgett 1992: 146; also 2001)

Padgett views God as changing, therefore he is temporal.

Padgett proposes there are two types of time:
- Measured Time: the time of humans, history, and our universe
- Metaphysical Time:

God is present in both of these times, as are we. However, God’s time transcends ours and us.

- In this way, God is “**relatively timeless**”
- God is timeless relative to our measured time by virtue of transcending it
- This means he is unaffected by the negative effects of temporal passage

- God created Measured Time
- God’s life cannot be contained in measured amounts of physical time

Metaphysical time has no metric or ability to be measured by temporal intervals.

The measure of time is due to the laws of nature

- Since God is immune to these, he is immune to temporal measurement

The succession which God experiences is the progression of his own consciousness and actions rather than external constraints.

- After God creates the universe, there is a metric inside the created time.
- This means God coincides with some of this physical, measured time but it is not part of or belong to God’s divine life.

The main difference between this and timelessness is:

- God remains capable of change even when no change happens in the divine life
- Therefore God can change before creation and after it

#### Problems:

- There is no clear distinction between the two times other than one can be measured
- There are different views as to what time is
  - Padgett denies the B-theory of time (temporal properties are fundamentally relational, events do not change), which Padgett admits would be the only way for God to be timeless in the original sense
- How can God be in both?
- How can we be in both?
- Divine foreknowledge is still an issue

### Swinburne

God is backwardly and forwardly everlasting, i.e. God never began to exist.



There is one logically consistent way to understand “S began to exist” given that the universe has a beginning (before which there could have been time with no metric):

- S existed for some period of time after a period of time in which it didn’t exist

Therefore “S will stop existing” means that:

- S will exist for some period of time before a period of time in which it won’t exist

Therefore Time could not begin to exist as that would be equivalent to:

- Time existed for some period of time after a period of time where it didn’t exist

Which is logically impossible (there can’t be a period of time where there isn’t time). Similarly, time can have no end.



God never began to exist. Therefore God existed for a period of time and there was no earlier period where he did not. Therefore God has existed for every past period of time. It follows that God could have existed before the universe and a system of metric time.



Topology of time and Metric of time:

- Topology: a succession of periods of time
- Metric: measure of length of the succeeding periods of time

Time must have a topology (for time to be there there must be a succession of periods of time), but it does not need a metric.

- If there is a before to when the universe existed, then there would have been no system by which to measure time but there is still a succession of events (if not within this non-metric time then by the creation of a universe there is a succession)



Finally:

If the universe didn’t always exist, God did.

- Before creation, God lives alone in a **metrically amorphous** time (it cannot be measured)
- After God creates the universe and laws of nature, this time acquires a metric
  - This means that only after the creation is God temporal and there begins to be differences between temporal intervals
- Before this metric time God could have had different conscious experiences at different periods of time or just one constant one
- By creating the universe, God caused there to be a metric to time and so afterwards all of God’s knowledge states, intentions,  thoughts and actions occur on a metric scale of time
- This metric only occurred because God intentionally caused or allowed it to occur

Furthermore:

- If God is immutable then if he exists he necessarily always exists and always will
- There are two senses to immutable:
  - Strong sense: God cannot change at all in any respect
  - Weak sense: God cannot change his essential properties

Swinburne argues that a strongly immutable God would be very lifeless and inactive, this opposes the idea of the Judeo-Christian God who frequently interacts with and responds.

#### Problems:

- Argument depends on accepting Swinburne’s definitions of coming into existence.
- If God is omniscient, would the knowledge of events change after the metric of time being given.

## Language & Knowledge

| Language                                                     | Knowledge                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| We don’t know what eternal means: it simply describes the relationship of God to time. | We can’t know if God is temporal or atemporal.               |
| Language is constrained by inherently being rooted in time   | We don’t know what time is.                                  |
| Language used to describe God’s knowledge is faulty/cannot describe something outside time. | Our knowledge is limited compared to God’s, it may be impossible to reach omniscience if God’s knowledge is atemporal. |
| If God is timeless, language used to refer to God with any reference to time is meaningless. | Can we know something atemporal if we are temporal?          |

## Timelessness as a possible solution to the inconsistent triad

Inconsistent triad:

1. Evil exist

2. God is omnipotent
3. God is benevolent

At most only two premises can be true:

- If God is benevolent and omnipotent, evil ought not exist
  - God is either unable to stop evil, thus impotent
  - Or God can stop evil, whereupon he is not benevolent

However, if we accept the premise that God is timeless, then this is an issue which uses time references ascribed to God

- It is meaningless to ask why God doesn’t stop the evil existing or which has or will exist
  - As God is outside of time.
- It is asking why a timeless being does not act in time.

HOWEVER: This then raises the issue as to how God is able to act at all in this temporal world.



## The problem of divine foreknowledge (prescience)

If God knows beforehand what we will do, how can we act freely?

- If humans’ freedom is not already set in stone, the variability of the outcome of it makes God’s knowledge of what is to come uncertain  
- Boethius claims that making this statement about God is, “wicked”, as it is in essence doubting his ‘all-knowing’ intelligence
  - Furthermore, this would fundamentally change God’s knowledge as God would then know that we *had* chosen to/done something. This could mean God changes and so is temporal.
- In other words, it goes against the idea that God is omniscient
  - Or timeless
- In essence, either humans have the ability to *change* God’s knowledge of the future; or humans’ future is already determined according to God’s knowledge:

However, Boethius argues that:

- A being who is timelessly eternal knows all things in time as if they were the **present**
- God knows events because they happen, rather than them happening because he foreknows them
- For God’s eternal present, events are **not** contingent, but necessary in a way which does not limit freedom as they occur
- Future events are necessary in the same way as an event in the present is necessarily happening
- This way, in the future when the events happen *necessarily*, they are free.

Boethius still believes that God is the determiner of all things. Although there is no divine prescience infringing on free mental will, there is a a divine predetermination of the things which will occur. Boethius adds this, almost in passing, afterwards.

- We are free to do the action and the mental events which occur, but they are predetermined

Some find that this almost ruins the elaborate defence of contingent human mental actions of will.

- How can we have mental actions of free will if the choice of what we will do with that is already set?



Others, however, do not view this as a problem for God but as a problem for us

- It is a problem of language:
  - We fundamentally misommunicate what time is or God’s knowledge or freedom
  - God’s knowledge does not work in line with how our language works
  - There is a misinterpretation/difference in interpretation of what freedom is

- It is a problem of knowledge:
  - We do not even know what time is, or freedom, or God’s knowledge
  - We cannot understand God, transcendence (reasons for this could for example be Aquinas’ proposition of what it is to know something and God’s simplicity being incompatible)
    - Some may say this is a reliance on transcendence to avoid a damning flaw in reasoning.
