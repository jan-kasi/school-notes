# ch 14-15
## the jesuits
- evangelism and proselytisation
- education
- ignatious founded the order
- vows of poverty, chastity, celibacy and obediency. with a special one of obedience to the pope

- went to Paraguay in 1558. Pope gave the Jesuits power to abolish the laws making the natives slaves to spanish conquistadores
- Voltaire praised the jesuits in spite of their satire in *Candide*

- "Empire within an Empire"- the Spanish had the territory but the Jesuits had the political control, not the Spanish Forces

## stuff in Candide
- Jesuits at war
  - they are meant to be a religious order, not a state or miliitary power
  - militaristic nature of the jesuits, Ignatious modelled the Jesuit order after an army
- "Los Padres* own everything, and the people own the rest"
  - satire of inequality of wealth and power
  - "justice and reason" -- irony
- Jesuits act in Europe as they should, but in South America they act as thier own kingdoms and not as they should
- behave as supporters of the King in Europe but against the King in Paraguay
- Jesuits living as the royals in europe do
- corruption of power
- inequality "gold vessels" vs. "wooden bowls...open fields"
- "master" Candide: slavery reference
- "negro slaves": the Jesuits did not explicitly enslave the paraguayans but were more than happy to import slaves from Africa

15
- no surprises, we have been told Candide is going to kill Cunegonde's brother from the chapter title
- suffers the same fate as Cunegonde, but is left for dead and Jesuits nurse him to health, "even prettier than before"
- he is inniciated to Order and quickly promoted
- head of Jesuits refered to as a "General", he is "recuiting" to send men to the New World. --> very militaristic
- "Reverend Father Croust"-- head of Jesuit college in Colmar, anti-philosophe, anti-Enlightnement.
- "I am now colonel and priest" --> should be oxymoronic/incompatible
- satirising works of Rousseau: "all men are equal"
  - Pangloss' own view
  - ironic as Candide is clearly not equal, he is not good enough to marry Cunegonde
  - ironic, they retain priveledge of wealth and status
- even after doing so much for Cunegonde and after Cunegonde has been through so much, Candide is still not allowed to marry her.
