# 01 Initial Archetypes 
Rooster as a Robin Hood-like figure
- living in woods with a band of "merry men"
- outside society
- "giving" to the poor
as a Jesus-like figure?
- outside society
- with a band of followers
- harassed by authorities

But Rooster subverts these too, or fulfills them in an unexpected way.





- same setting as Midsummernight's dream
  - professor comes in and starts yelling about Titania
- setting of As You Like It
