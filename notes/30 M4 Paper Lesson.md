# 30 M4 Paper Lesson

> Thus he stipulates...his turn.

For Aristotle:

...


non-predicated ideas are simply assented. "the cow" --> assented to: yes, this is a cow.

"the cow is purple" --> is this a cow? is it purple? (does this correspond to reality?)

For Descartes, there can be judged non-predicate ideas. An idea can exist without predicates "the cow" (does this idea correspond to reality?).


In M4, judgement is a loose concept: judgment of whether something corresponds to reality can cover both predicated and non-predicated ideas.



What is the nature of this Will?
|Jesuits|Oratorians|
|--|--|
|Liberty of Spontaneity|Liberty of Indifference|

Descartes sidesteps the conflict as
1. human beings have freedom because they have a Will present within them, given by God (Indifference/positive freedom)
2. Error comes from free will, the Will has a wider scope than the intellect and thus make wrong judgements. The Will is entirely free from constraints (Spontaneity/Negative)

We have positive freedom, the Will has negative freedom (yet it is constrained by the system (humans),although it is still entirely free within the system)
We have free will (choices, etc.) but not freedom (dominion).
