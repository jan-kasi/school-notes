# 30 M4 Paper Lesson

> Thus he stipulates...his turn.

For Aristotle:

...


non-predicated ideas are simply assented.
They are 


For Descartes, there can be predicated non-predicate ideas. An idea can exist without predicates


In M4, judgement is a loose concept: judgment of whether something corresponds to reality can cover both predicated and non-predicated ideas.



What is the nature of this Will?
|Jesuits|Oratorians|
|--|--|
|Liberty of Spontaneity|Liberty of Indifference|

Descartes sidesteps the conflict as
1. human beings have freedom because they have a Will present within them, given by God (Indifference/positive freedom)
2. Error comes from free will, the Will has a wider scope than the intellect and thus make wrong judgements. The Will is entirely free from constraints (Spontaneity/Negative)

We have positive freedom, the Will has negative freedom (yet it is constrained by the system (humans),although it is still entirely free within the system)
