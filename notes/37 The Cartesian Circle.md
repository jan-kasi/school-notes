# 37 The Cartesian Circle

## Reading
Richard Francks, Descartes' Meditations, p135-147 section 3.4.3.

1. What is the Cartesian Circle
  - The argument that Descartes' disproof of skepticism is invalid due to being circular. That the argument  presupposes what it is claiming in order to claim it.
  - The most common formulation of the argument claimed to be Descartes' circular argument is,
  > A.
  > 1 I have a Clear and Distinct Idea that God exists and is no deceiver
  > 2 So it is true that God exists and is no deceiver
  > 3 So Clear and Distinct Ideas are true [an a priori claim]
  
  - But perhaps Descartes really means,
  > B
  > 1 I can't doubt my Clear and Distinct Ideas [an evidential claim, a posteriori]
  > 2 I have a Clear and Distinct Idea that God exists and is no deceiver
  > 3 So I can't doubt that God exists and is no deceiver
  > 4 So what I can't doubt must objectively be true

  - Argument A cannot get from 1 to 2 if you haven't already established 3. You don't know that God is really no deceiver and exists unless you know your Clear and Distinct Ideas are true.
  - Argument B doesn't have this same problem, as 1-3 don't assume that Clear and Distinct Ideas are true (only that they can't be doubted).
  - There is another structural problem for B that 4 (claim that what can't be doubted must be true) might not follow from 1-3, but rather
  > 5 I can't doubt that my Clear and Distinct Ideas are true

  - The circle is avoided by an unjustified leap. What we want to prove is 4, but it isn't proven simply assumed by a leap.
  - There is also a problem of justification. Descartes' available processes are the problem in question, if they are reliable or not, so he appeals to God to solve the problem. The issue is that it isn't necessarily the case that someone's *knowledge of* God can justify human knowledge without running into some version of the Cartesian Circle or making an unjustified leap to avoid it, even if it is true that *God* could solve the problem of justification for human knowledge.

2. Which Meditations are required to meaningfully understand it
  - Meditations 1 and 2, to understand the problem of skepticism and type of doubt (a hyperbolic thought experiment) which Descartes' is trying to solve
  - Meditation 2 and 3 to understand CDP and CDI.
  - Meditation 5 (and maybe 3) to understand where Descartes makes an argument which may suffer the Cartesian Circle
3. Which Meditations are affected by it.
  - Any meditation in which CDP are treated as true, i.e. anything after "I am, I exist".
  - So any knowledge of external reality.
