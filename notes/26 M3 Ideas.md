# 26 M3 Ideas

## p96 objection
1. Hobbes' point
  - Disagreement of what an innate idea is
  - If there is a possibility that one isn't thinking/holding an idea, and innate ideas are always present, then we do not have innate ideas
2. Descartes' reply
  - Innate ideas do not need to be "always there before us", they are ideas which we have the faculty of summoning them up for
  - Assumption of what ideas are, how the mind works, that we all share the same ideas

## p96-98
1. Gassendi's point on adventitious and factitious ideas
  - Factitious ideas are really adventitious ideas changed by the mind's faculty to rearrange adventitious ideas.
  - Factitious are an unnecessary distinction, you only have adventitious ideas and adventitious ideas mushed together by the mind, both dependent on external sources.
2. Gassendi's point on innate ideas
  - Any idea claimed to be innate seems to be able to come from an external origin (??)
3. Descartes' reply
  - The argument is fallacious, one can use it to claim a sculptor (Praxatelis) doesn't make any statues because the materials didn't come from within the sculptor, he simply rearranged the marble without the imagination.
  - To claim that the mind can rearrange ideas, therefore a rearranged idea is not made by the mind is a contradiction.
  - Gassendi assumes that a blind man has no idea of colour. Alternatively it is as possible to claim that a blind man does not have an idea of colour because they lack the mental faculty to form them as that it is reliant on external factors they cannot perceive.
