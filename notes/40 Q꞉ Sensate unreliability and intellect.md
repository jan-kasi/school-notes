# 40 Q: Sensate unreliability and intellect

a. Explain how Descartes concludes that information acquired through our senses is unreliable.
b. Evaluate the claim that it is not through the senses that we know truth, but through the intellect.

b evaluate THE CLAIM, not evaluate Descartes' claim!!! i.e. be careful.

ideas:
M4 is about truth and falsity, error theodicy.
Primary and secondary qualities: there are some things which we have reliability of through the senses with the intellect, that something is extended.
M1 Sensory doubt/demon
Empiricism vs rationalism

## A
1 M1 Sensory doubt (empiricism vs rationalism), this could be the introduction "Descartes starts the meditaiton with...
- The senses do not perceive many things truly, instead they "often deceive" us.
- Waves of doubt in M1 mean that sensate information is doubtable and not truly perceived.
(- Yet, "the scope of the intellect" is such that these confusions are held equally to those truly perceived, such as the "clear...conclusion" that God exists. Therefore information acquired by the senses is unreliable by deceiving the intellect.)
- "there is very little about corporeal things that is truly perceived"

2 CDP (and primary quality?): where does the truth of CDP come from (D: intellect, Empiricists: senses)

3 Error theory - M4

### OR a better way:
1. M1/2 Malicious Demon: sensory doubt, link to B with bounded/unbounded doubt, Cartesian circle links?
2. Med 4, Scope of the Will: error theory
- Then bring in CDP
3. Wax argument, representational/formal reality (rationalism, senses are involved in finding truth but do not determine it. Shows what you can and what you can't know. Maybe M2 p26 "something which I thought I was seeing with my eyes is in fact grasped soley by the faculty of judgement which is in my mind."
- extension is NOT a CDP, primary quality/extension is something which you CANNOT clearly and distinctly perceive, but you know is there.
Might switch 2 and 3 to bridge from what you can and can't know towards error.

## B

Using better structure:
D believes it is through the intellect, but perceived through senses?

1. 
2. Wax
- Something you can't explain, simply called immaterial. Category error. 
- Similarly, you can't know its nature Objection
- undermined by malicious demon, assuming unbounded doubt (mention if bounded then why does it not extend towards intellect). Unbounded discussion that if so then error could be caused in both senses and intellect, and both can be doubted. Descartes' escape leads to arcs which cannot escape as primary extension is not a CDP.
- Therefore you cannot know that "something exists" 
3.
