# 12 The Problem of Chance
All cosmological arguments assume that chance is a worse explanation than intelligent and purposeful/intended cause

## is chance a better explanation?
- this does not explain why something exists instead of not, simply how it happened
- cosmological asks why something exists instead of not, chance simply explains how it happens not *why*
  - mechanistic vs teleological episteme/language game?


if rephrased it may suffer from fallacy of composition

either way this comes down to what a sufficient exlpanation is


Occam's Razor: the simplest explanation is likely to be correct (makes the least assumptions)
Hume's view: the most reasonable explanation is likely to be correct


depends on what "simplest" and "most reasonable" are
- opposite complex and unreasonable
