# 05 Man  as a Blank Slate
- tabula rasa

[Sidenote start

Aristotle:
> "Give me a child until he is 7 and I will show you the man" 

You are fixed by your upbrigning (environment and socialisation)
- But the type of person you are is not the unifying human experience which makes you human
- Links to virtues

Sidenode end]

## Locke
- Humans are born with an empty mind which is filled with ideas from our experiences
Essay concerning human understanding
### Associationism
All thought is formed by a comparison of ideas which are made by combining of things from sense perception
- important to learn about this for rigour and deep discussion of how we form associations/imagination etc.
## Watson
All behaviour is a trained response to stimuli
"No dividing line between man and brute"
### Classical conditioning
Stimulus association conditions everyone the same. there is no difference between the way we learn
