# 45 Q: Mind as entity different to the body
a. Explain Descartes' argument regarding the distinction between "what pertains to [the mind ... and] what is referred to the body".
b. Evaluate Descartes' argument regarding the distinction between "what pertains to [the mind ... and] what is referred to the body".

Chose to state that Descartes uses mind and soul interchangeably/synonymously, mind is the immaterial aspect which survives after death.

## A
M6 and M2 (def of mind. cogito: certainty)

mind body distinction
cogito

## B

Challenge the idea that there is a distinction between mind and body.

Challenge that you rest trust in the mind/certainty coming from the mind. You use the mind to prove the mind. Attacking the evidence for the mind (which for Descartes' *is* the mind)


NOTHING on Cartesian circle.
