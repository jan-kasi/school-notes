# 09 Kalam Cosmological Argument
- Al-Ghazali

## William Lane Craig repopularised the Kalam Cosmological argument

Emphasis is on the impossibility of infinity, not on the necessary nature of God

1. Everything that begins to exist has a cause of existence
2. The Universe began to exist
3. Infinite regress of causes is impossible
4. Therefore the Universe has a cause for its existence

Infinity is only a concept of the mind and not a metaphysical reality
The Universe is not, therefore it has no place for a "real" infinity
If infinity doesn't "exist", then an infinite regress is impossible
Therefore the number of past events is finite
So there was a beginning to the Universe

This does not need anything from the nature of God as God is unknowable in Islam.


No problem of religious language about God or knowledge of God. Perhaps.

The focus is on the nature of the Universe, not of God. (Perhaps)

Infinity:
- it is not a number, it is the concept of boundlessness
It is incorrectly used linguistically as a very big uncountable number, not that it is boundless.

infinity - infinity = infinity or 0 or anything
there are no "odds" or "evens" in infinity

infinite is unknown
infinite is unprovable
infinite is not real

when you realise what infinity *is*, you realise that an infinite regress of things isn't impossible

Bertrand Russel is resting on an assumption of reality when he says it *is* possible


## Thoughts which come to mind
Hume:
- inductive problems
- fallacy of composition
- etc.
- Not nature of God, but nature of universe can apply.
- same problems still emerge


problem of knowledge

Islamic issue of Universe:
- observable and unobservable universe
- to make an induction about universe beyond (which contains God) without anything is weak perhaps (and from the observable perhaps different)

1 and 2 can still be criticised


Absurdity of infinity can be used as an argument against infinite regress
Accepting Big Bang denies infinity---all matter inside a singularity, therefore finite matter


There is no evidence of either: theists denying the infinite and atheists accepting it sometimes. No one can prove either.


Applying language to reality. It doesn't work.
