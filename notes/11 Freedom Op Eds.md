# 11 Freedom Op Eds
## Notes
(pages 263-278)
### Terms and definitions

**Determinism**:

- Everything has a cause or a set of causes
- Given the cause(s), what happened had to happen and nothing else could have happened
  - This can refer to natural events and laws of nature, as well as humans
- Some determinists believe our choices do not come from free will but from a series of causes which made them inevitable (and theoretically predictable)
- Several forms of determinism:

Hard determinism:

- Every human action and choice is the inevitable result of a set of causes
- Eliminates possibility of human freedom
- Most are materialists who base their beliefs on human beings as material beings therefore subjected to inescapable laws of nature.
- A consequence of hard determinism could be difficulty in maintaining to hold people responsible to their actions.
  - Moral responsibility *could* disappear

Soft determinism:

- Many external factors influence our decisions but an element of freedom still remains
- Some of the causes leading to inevitable results are internal causes which we have some control over
- We are able to (partially) determine ourselves out of free will
- Choices may be limited by external factors but we still have some choice and power over alternatives
- Moral responsibility maintained

**Libertarianism**:

- Human beings are free agents
- Although material world is determined by laws of nature and causation, human choices are not subjected to them
- Recognise that we are (at least partly) material beings
- Agree that we are influenced by external factors but free will can always be exercised
- Most human actions are the result of a free choice (except coercion)

**Fatalism**:

- At least some events are set in advance and we cannot change them
- Tend to focus on an inevitable *end*
- We might have freedom up until this end or around it
  - This might be meaningless given the final result of actions is already predetermined, but we have free will around/up to it

**Compatibalism**:

- Determinism and free will are compatible
  - e.g. soft determinists

**Incompatibalism**:

- Determinism and free will are incompatible and cannot coexist
  - Either we are completely free (libertarianism) or we are not free at all (hard determinism)

### What do we mean by cause?

| Libertarianism                                               | Soft determinism                                             | Hard determinism                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Free will is the main cause of human choice and actions. Actions are unpredictable because people chose between alternatives, this power over alternatives is free. Despite external influence, free will overrides these. | Some actions are entirely determined by external causes and do not involve choice. Other actions are the result of internal causes such as desires and preference. These internal causes are also determined ultimately | Free will is never, in itself, the cause of human choices or actions. Actions are caused by external factors we cannot control. Free will is not a thing, it is just a feeling or illusion. |



### Richard Taylor

Contemporary philosopher. Argues humans are free agents and that there is no such thing as soft determinism.

Once there is an external cause which isn’t the self, it is in the same territory as hard determinism. There is no halfway point.



## Which point of view we have considered so far in the presentations is the most compelling?

Pinker’s arguments are most compelling to maintain responsibility as a policy of deterrence regardless of the positions taken of free will. This is because it does not rely on any single position such as libertarianism, hard determinism, soft determinism, to explain why responsibility is still useful. However, Pinker does assume incompatibalism throughout the extract when discussing why determinisms might remove free will and responsibility. This section can be ignored and only the reasons for responsibility isolated and Pinker’s arguments still make sense and work across the rest.

For theological determinism, the Akan fatalist view is most compelling because it is an interesting and nuanced view which contains destiny, individuality, and purpose into the unique Okra of a person and still allows for freedom. 

The ideas of Marx and Engels of losing autonomy in industry and the extent of will being determined by the class in society they are born in, as well as historical materialism are also very compelling as a way to add nuance to free will. Also it lets us use Marxist jargon, which is always fun.



## Does theological determinism eliminate human freedom?

Not necessarily. Some forms of theological determinism might limit the freedom we have towards an end (fatalism) but not on the way there, for example the Akan presentation. We have an end, destiny, but are free anyway. We must arrive at this destiny but are free to deviate from it and towards it and chose up to it.
