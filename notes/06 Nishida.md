The Freedom of the Will

Influenced by Kant and Hegel


- The Will is free
- Individuality is created by the wiill
- The will is a mind-dependant phenomena of consciousness

- Ontological freedom and freedom of action both belong to the will and are therefore not distinct


- We are free within a sphere of action
  - we have an asymetrical relationship with our surroundings which imposes limitations on us
  - but people more limited are not less free or free at all
- we only have freedom over our own phenomena of consciousness
  - but subconscious
- ontological freedom
  - but we are not free through a priori definitions of freedom


- freedom is laid out in a spectrum
  - it is something which is possessed in quantitites


  - The will has no cause and is an expression of the self
