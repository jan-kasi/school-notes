# 02 Verifiction
## Logical positivism
- Adopted by the Vienna Circle, avoided metaphysics as meaningless, believed the task of the philosopher was the **logical analysis of sentences**: separating the meaningful from the meaningless

- Moritz Schlick

- Brought to attention by A.J. Ayer in the very influential *Language, Truth and Logic* (1936) which became a bestseller
  - Seemed to make many traditional branches of philosophy—including philosophy of religion, ethics, aesthetics, metaphysics, and many versions of epistemology—both irrelevant and meaningless
- Logical positivists concerned with what they could say:
  - Scientists were the best people to describe the universe, not philosophers
  - Philosophers didn’t find real truth
- Hegelianism was the dominant theory in European thought in the late 19th/20th century but the rise of logical positivism and the devastating effects of WW1 made it hard to believe in inevitable progress

- Much of 20th century philosophy was a reaction to the downfall of Hegelianism
- Logical positivists argue that it is no business of the philosopher to say anything at all about the world

### Verification theory

- If philosophers can say nothing about the world, what use are they? (paper 3 link)

- Logical positivists argue that philosopher’s task is to analyse the logical structure of sentences; to determine whether a sentence is meaningful or nonsense (this doesn’t mean true or false)
- For logical positivists only **tautologies** and **empirically verifiable propositions** are meaningful propositions
- You test meaningfulness ***first***, and ***then*** you test if it is true in reality
  - Only if something is meaningful can you ask if it is true or false
- Meaningfulness is assessing what type of statement something is: can it be proven, is it useless, can it be tested for truth? 
- Something can be meaningful and false
  - Meaningful and false/not true: “Mr Piggott has black hair”

#### Tautologies

A priori, true by definition

- a triangle has 3 sides, x=x

  —What we have is a ***truth***, not a fact

  A truth is something where the predicate is contained within the subject, a fact is something which refers outwardly to the world

Self-verifying

#### Empirically verifiable propositions

A sentence whose truth can be determined by observation

Tells us something beyond itself and not simply a meaning of its own terms

Tells us something claimed as a matter of *fact*

- Observation needed to determine if true
- e.g. “Ben Nevis is the highest mountain”
  - The mountain must be seen, measured, compared with others…
  - This is meaningful because it can be verified or tested
  - This is false because it doesn’t state “in the UK”, which would make it true. We know it is not the highest mountain in the world, let alone the whole universe. It is implied “the highest mountain [ever]”
- Observation may be **direct** or **indirect**
  - e.g. “I am sitting at my desk”, “The current monarch is Queen Elizabeth II”



- Not all sentences can be determined by observation and so for a logical positivist would be meaningless
- e.g. “The universe doubled in size” is not (currently) empirically verifiable or possible to observe. If the universe doubled in size nothing observable would have changed and there would be nothing for a scientist to investigate
