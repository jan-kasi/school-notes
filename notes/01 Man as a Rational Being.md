# 01 Man as a Rational Being

Is there a shared human nature? Is this being rational?

## Are we rational beings?

Nudge theory

What does it mean to be a rational being

Is rationality separate from emotion?

- can you be emotional *and* rational

Hedonic calculus (Bentham): yes we are rational beings

Too rational –> bad?

Kantian ethics/deontology

Virtue ethics, you do not need to be rational as you become virtuous by habit

Objectivity, autonomy, self evidence?



Specism?
## Frankfurt sausage

- Freedom of Action: acting out desire
- Freedom of Will: second order aligns with first order desire



## :platododge:

For Plato, man has autonomy, objectivity, and knowledge

e.g. thirsty man and poisoned water


Tripartite soul: reason, base impulses, spirit (passion)

Important part is your rationality for Plato


Simile of the dividing line: we can only access doxa rather than phenesis

Anamenesis is how we “remember” from the world of forms as our soul has experienced :platododge:

Phenomenal/Experience seems to support conflict within desires. There is a desire to do something but also a contrary desire able to control it which seems to stem from a different source (base desire for water, and deciding not to drink poison. Example of smoking, base desire due to addiction, perhaps a desire to smoke due to anger/stress/emotive reasons, and reasoning not to for health reasons). We tend to be able to control these desires by thinking about things outside of impulse and make a judgement about which desires to allow. Even if not drinking poison/not smoking is also a desire, there seems to be a need for conscious choice in many instances.
But it may be a more refined and powerful set of desires, not a separate autonomous part. However, phenomenal experience suggests that often these desires conflict quite evenly or even one which is painful to chose is chosen for what are not the same category of desire. Perhaps reason then is preserved as acting with a very long term or refined desire (e.g. to live or to be right), so it may equally appear to be another desire, but the thing allowing us to chose this desire which may be more "telos" but weaker in force is ratio (allowing us to proportionally see things and make a judgement outside of the desire's pure strength). Game theory link problems: is it rational to prioritise one's own survival or try to maximise the groups's? Example of other species too. What is rational does not seem to absolute but dependant on circumstance/value-systems (link to Fucault) and how Power is involved.

Critique possible with AI more difficult but possible. Learning algorhythms do not have desires, but are capable of superior ratio (if understood as making a decision objectively), but they do not have anamenesis.

## Rationalism

- Plato
- Descartes
  - Indubitable truths

We can build a system of knowledge from self-evident truths

- Nothing can be true and false at the same time
- Everything either is, or is not
- Nothing happens without a reason

Rationalists argue that to deny these is absurd. They underpin our reasoning and allow us to look objectively at the world.

They underpin our reasoning and allow us to look objectively at the world.

- Plato appeals to forms
- Descartes appeals to everyday reasoning about the world

## Descartes

- “I exist” is indubitably true as its truth is demonstrated in the very act of thinking or speaking
- Schopenhauer puts forward other basic logical principles that are accepted by rationalists as self evident: Law of contradiction, law of identity, law of sufficient reason.
