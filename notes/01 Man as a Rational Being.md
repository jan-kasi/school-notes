# 01 Man as a Rational Being

Is there a shared human nature? Is this being rational?

## Are we rational beings?

Nudge theory

What does it mean to be a rational being

Is rationality separate from emotion?

- can you be emotional *and* rational

Hedonic calculus (Bentham): yes we are rational beings

Too rational –> bad?

Kantian ethics/deontology

Virtue ethics, you do not need to be rational as you become virtuous by habit

Objectivity, autonomy, self evidence?



Specism?
## Frankfurt sausage

- Freedom of Action: acting out desire
- Freedom of Will: second order aligns with first order desire



## :platododge:

For Plato, man has autonomy, objectivity, and knowledge

e.g. thirsty man and poisoned water



Tripartite soul: reason, base impulses, spirit (passion)

Important part is your rationality for Plato



Simile of the dividing line: we can only access doxa rather than phenesis

Anamenesis is how we “remember” from the world of forms as our soul has experienced :platododge:





## Rationalism

- Plato
- Descartes
  - Indubitable truths

We can build a system of knowledge from self-evident truths

- Nothing can be true and false at the same time
- Everything either is, or is not
- Nothing happens without a reason

Rationalists argue that to deny these is absurd. They underpin our reasoning and allow us to look objectively at the world.

They underpin our reasoning and allow us to look objectively at the world.

- Plato appeals to forms
- Descartes appeals to everyday reasoning about the world

## Descartes

- “I exist” is indubitably true as its truth is demonstrated in the very act of thinking or speaking
- Schopenhauer puts forward other basic logical principles that are accepted by rationalists as self evident: Law of contradiction, law of identity, law of sufficient reason.
