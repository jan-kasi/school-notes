# II ch 7-12
## Heathcliff
### Heathcliff's plan
- Heathcliff sees himself as a mastermind of a plan
- Trying to push Catherine and Linton to marry, allowing him to control both houses
- Context: Cathy may not be able to inherit Linton's property

### Ends of ch 11 and 12
- References to death and tyranny, Heathcliff increasingly ominous and uncaring
- Linton fading from the narrative as he slowly dies
- Uncertainty and mistrust, e.g. "what to hide and what to reveal"

### Heathcliff's treatment of Hareton and Linton
- Punishing Hareton for Hindley's transgressions against him
- Vengeance as primary motivator -> link to revenge tragedy genre
- Lack of family and parental background -> uses Linton to secure his plan
  - highlights HC's misanthropy
  - even his son is manipulated and despised
- He is becoming the bad character, becoming worse than the person he is trying to punish
  - Almost like a Gothic double

## Edgar Linton
### EL's change over the course of the book
- physical weakness
- psychological weakness, he is unable to manipulate others as he did before
- Loses control over Cathy ("abandon her to him") and awareness of her actions
- Then loses even more control as he loses to Hareton
- Loses control from complete forbidding to moderate punishments

- Sympathy for Edgar changes
  - He seems more manipulated and weak as HC becomes more tyrannical
  - Sees Catherine being manipulated, but participates in this anyway
  - Pathos, he thinks that if he dies then Cathy will be completely under HC's mercy (but she still is even when EL is alive)
  - Guilt tripping Catherine
  - Thinks he knows what will make Cathy happy

## Nelly
- Narrative voice
- Midpoint/messenger between EL and Cathy (again, except TG and WG characters switched)
- Knows and influences both the 
- Portrays herself as trustworthy and knowing everything
- Unreliability
  - Nelly's sickness but still talks as if she has first hand info
  - Cathy cares for Nelly
  - Almost writes herself as a crime novel where she figures it all out
  - Inconsistency in telling Cathy about the severity of characters' illnesses
  - Portrays herself as moral and makes her case for Cathy being a great person to marry
  - Timeless perspective spanning all generations -> inconsistencies
    - Allusions to different generations saying very similar things and acting in very similar ways

## Cathy, Hareton and Linton




## Parallels
- Gothic theme of past and present closely related and linked
