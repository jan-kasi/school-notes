# ch 17-18 Depiction of Eldorado

## Write a paragraph explaining how Eldorado is depicted in Chapters 17–18 (400–500 words)

Eldorado is presented as a Utopia of riches and civility, detached from society and foreign influences. Voltaire satirises the idea that the world is the same everywhere as Cacambo presents it, “‘You see, this hemisphere is no better than the other one…let us go back to Europe’” by the characters finding themselves in this “perfect” land. Voltaire depicts Eldorado as a “big improvement”, yet still the characters are determined to not stay; even though Cacambo is proven wrong—there are better and worse places in the world—both characters wish to return to what they know and are familiar with. This satire of human greed is explained by the King when he tells them it is “a foolish scheme…when you are reasonably happy somewhere, you should stay put.” Furthermore their logic of living as kings once they leave is satirised, as the common children live better than many of the royalty in Europe. The satire is that there is a wish to be better than others, not to “be happy”. Therefore the Optimism the novel is a satire of is shown as inconsistent: even the characters who most dogmatically hold it want to be better than others and are not content with being equal.

That Candide and Cacambo leave the lands with their “pebbles” which are gold and gems could be seen as a comment on the nature of colonialism. Voltaire shows colonialism as destroying and imposing a different value system to a land, and as unreasonable to the indigenous communities. This is especially seen as Eldorado being a hidden land which the Incan people retreated to after colonial invasion, the citizens of Eldorado are presented as extremely kind and civil, and even willingly giving Cacambo and Candide their precious gems. This could be seen as a criticism of the nature of colonialism as unnecessary forceful taking, which destroys the beneficial cultural exchange and collaboration otherwise possible and means that the real treasures are not able to be gained or shared by pushing them away. Voltaire then criticises colonialism as a self defeating force with no benefits, the cultural exchange is stopped in favour of a lesser form of material taking than would’ve been possible without the colonial imposition by driving cultures away.
