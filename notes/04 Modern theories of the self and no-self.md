# 04 Modern theories of the self and no-self
## Hume context
Bundle theory:
Middle ground between the self and no-self
[recap]
Knowledge is based on experience, we cannot determine the self as existing if it cannot be empirically confirmed
We don't experience the self, just senses and experiences around us and *induce* that a self exists.
E.g. example of a storm, we don't experience the storm but the side effects.
We are made of a bundle of senses and perceptions.

## Kant
rationalism vs empiricism emerge as competing schools of thought.
Self can be deduced from sense perception.
"starry heavens above and the moral law within"
Unity of the self
Phenomenal and Noumenal:
- phenomenal, as things appear to the observer
- noumenal, where everything real is

The self is something which rationalises experiences
The existence of self can be proven through its very being
## Strawson
Idea of the self is nonsensical.
Sensations of pain drive our very being
