## Copied The Focus on Global Issues.docx which outlines stuff about the oral 
Examine the ways in which the global issue of your choice is presented through the content and form of two of the texts that you have studied.  
​ 
The individual oral is based on the exploration the student has carried out in the learner portfolio. During this exploration process, the student will have investigated a series of literary works and a variety of global issues. In the lead up to the individual oral, the student must make a decision about which global issue and which text and work will be explored in the task. Two works must be selected, one originally in English and one in translation. An extract of no more than 40 lines should be selected from each which is representative of the presence of the global issue in it.  
 
The text selected must have a clear connection with the global issue. The individual oral should be a well-supported argument about the ways in which both represent and explore the global issue. Students must select two extracts (one from each text) that clearly show significant moments when this global issue is being focused on. Normally these extracts should not exceed 40 lines or present an unmanageable amount of material to be analysed. The student brings unannotated copies of these extracts to the individual oral.  
 
​The extracts are meant to help students focus their responses, remove the need to learn quotations and enable them to explore more precise issues, such as style, specific devices and other distinct techniques used by authors to present the global issue. The choice of extracts should show the student’s understanding of the relevance of the part to the whole and enable coverage of larger and smaller choices made by the writers to shape their perspectives on the global issue.  
​ 
A global issue incorporates the following three properties: 

- It has significance on a wide/large scale. 

- It is transnational. 

- Its impact is felt in everyday local contexts.  

 
Students may look to one or more of the following fields of inquiry for guidance on how to decide on a global issue to focus their orals on. These topics are not exhaustive and are intended as helpful starting points for students to generate ideas and derive a more specific global issue on which to base their individual oral. It should also be noted that there is the potential for significant overlap between the areas.  
 
 
PLEASE NOTE: THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES ARE GLOBAL AREAS, NOT GLOBAL ISSUES.  FOR THE IO YOU ARE REQUIRED TO SPEAK ON A GLOBAL ISSUE, NOT A GLOBAL AREA. 
 
​ 
 
Culture, identity and community  
Students might focus on the way in which texts explore aspects of family, class, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender and sexuality, and the way these impact on individuals and societies. They might also focus on issues concerning migration, colonialism and nationalism.    
 
Beliefs, values and education  
Students might focus on the way in which texts explore the beliefs and values nurtured in particular societies and the ways they shape individuals, communities and educational systems. They might also explore the tensions that arise when there are conflicts of beliefs and values, and ethics.  
 
 
Politics, power and justice  
​Students might focus on the ways in which texts explore aspects of rights and responsibilities, the workings and structures of governments and institutions. They might also investigate hierarchies of power, the distribution of wealth and resources, the limits of justice and the law, equality and inequality, human rights and peace and conflict.  
 
 
Art, creativity and the imagination  
Students might focus on the ways in which texts explore aspects of aesthetic inspiration, creation, craft, and beauty. They might also focus on the shaping and challenging of perceptions through art, and the function, value and effects of art in society.  
 
 
Science, technology and the environment  
Students might focus on the ways in which texts explore the relationship between humans and the environment and the implications of technology and media for society. They might also consider the idea of scientific development and progress.  
In selecting the global issue for their oral, students must be careful not simply to select from the broad fields of inquiry above, but to determine a specific issue for discussion that can be reasonably explored. 
 
 
The global issue chosen for consideration should be significant on a wide scale, be transnational in nature, and be an issue that has an impact felt in everyday local contexts. The issue should be clearly evidenced in the extracts or texts chosen.  
 
 
​For example, within the field of culture, identity and community, the theme of gender in itself might be unsuitably broad for an individual oral. A student interested in this theme might explore instead how gender bias manifests itself in different contexts; how this can be evidenced in many ways in texts of different sorts; how different authorial choices will determine what is meant by gender bias; whether bias should be viewed positively or negatively, allowing the students to evaluate the writer’s choices and the impact they might have on the different readers’ or viewers’ understanding.  
 
 
The oral itself will only be concerned with the aspects of the global issue relevant to the two texts chosen. The student should ensure the oral offers a balanced approach, giving approximately equal attention to both texts. Thus, it is important that the student selects extracts/texts that offer equally sufficient material for the discussion.
