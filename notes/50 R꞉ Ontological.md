# 50 R꞉ Ontological

Three dangers, things to not do:
- Wrong version
- Too simplistic
- Too much focus on God's existence analytic (Kant)

A. Explain Ontological argument

1. Imagination/Understanding distinction. There are two ways to have ideas: those you have imagined and those you have understood. Imagination is something created by the mind, understanding is something "not dependant on me or created by my mind". 
2. An idea is not nothing. An idea's nature is separate to my mind when it is understood. Triangle example.
3. Idea of God contains existence as part of it's essence, (link to contingency arg.) causa sui. Miner develops this further. Existence is inseparable from God
4. Therefore God exists necessarily as existence is necessarily part of God's existence and he is causa sui (therefore able to exist in reality)

Valley and mountain are reciprocal terms, thus they are inseparable. Category error criticism possible: it can be one thing, many things, etc.
