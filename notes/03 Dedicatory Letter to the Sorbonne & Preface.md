# 03 Dedicatory Letter to the Sorbonne & Preface
3-9
- Descartes writes with purpose
- Faith is enough for the believer, but the non-believer demands a naturalistic explanation, which D will attempt to provide
- Proving that God exists and the real distinction between mind and body
- Descartes feels a personal responsibility to write the Meditations
- It is important to understand the order and connections in his argument, instead of picking at the individual sentences--i.e. the logic between, not within.
- Includes the criticism and responses, which form part of D's argument.
- Not very nice to atheists, basically says that atheists aren't very intelligent. "as for the atheists, who are generally posers..."
- Basically sucking up to the Sorbonne
- Clear agenda
- Questions falsehood: par: "would a benevolent God allow us to believe something which is false"
