# Simplicity
 Simplicity refers to God's oneness/unity of being (like Tawhid in Islam)

## Divine simplicity
God ***is*** the attributes he is associated with.

God is ***one***.

God is identical to his attributes.
- God is not characterised by these attributes, God is the attributes and they originate from him.
  - e.g. saying "Jack is human" means Jack possesses the attribute of human, but does not mean he *is* humanity; saying "God is wise" means that God possesses the attribute of wisdom and ***is*** wisdom.

God cannot be defined.

> ”You are therefore the very life by which You live [existence], the wisdom by which You are wise, the very goodness by which You are good to both good men and wicked… You are truth, You are goodness, You are blessedness, You are eternity, and You are every true good… There are no parts in You, Lord; neither are You many, but You are so much one and the same with Yourself than in nothing are You dissimilar with Yourself. Indeed You are unity itself not divisible by any mind. Life and wisdom and the other (attributes), then, are not parts of You, but all are one and each one of them is wholly what You are and what all others are”

—Anselm



## Core beliefs of the doctrine of divine simplicity

- God is identical to the attributes labelled to them.
- God isn’t enclosed/limited by the parameters of his attributes, he is the very parameters of the attribute.
- God cannot be described by us as he defies the conceptual ability we use to identify things. (Davies, also Aquinas) 
- Aquinas

### Aquinas

god has the ability to be the attributes he possesses.

“Josh is human” =/= “Josh is humanity”.

“God is wise” == “God is wisdom”.



### Initial conceptual problems

Plantinga:

- If God is identical to his properties, then these properties are equal to each other.
  - G=A, G=B. therefore A=B.
  - God is omnipotence, omniscience and benevolence. therefore omnipotence = omniscience = benevolence.
- If God is a property then he is only a property, not a person.

Davies:

- Divine Simplicity identifies God’s nature with God’s existence.
- Davies states that Aquinas claims God is existence, *suum esse* (his own existence) or *ipsum esse subsistens* (own existent substance).

Existence

- Saying “God is existence” is analogous to “God is analogous to a statement of numbers correlating to when a concept has instances of itself”. 
  - This doesn’t mean anything, it tells us nothing about God.


- Existence is not a predicate.

- If existence is a property of an object
  - Saying an object doesn’t exist, e.g “honest theologian doesn’t exist”.
  - We are talking about it so if it is a property of an object then it must exist. So we can’t say anything doesn’t exist.

### Defence

- Against Plantiga: Is it really a problem for God’s attributes to be the same?
- We can only know what God is through what he is not.
- God can be identical to his properties without his properties to equal each other.
  - x^2 different to 2x, but when x=2 they both = 4.
- God is divinity.
- Why do assume God has to be a physical person/not a concept?
