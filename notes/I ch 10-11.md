How is Heathcliff and Catherine's relationship presented by Bronte?

| Positively                                                   | Negatively                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| conventional romantic characterisation of heathcliff (tragedy, misanthropy, Romantic?) | Nothing massively bad happens while Heathcliff is away, he purposefully comes in for revenge and to “win” Catherine |
| heathcliff’s outsider status makes the reader more sympathetic to him | Their love is fundamentally doomed, tragic, and blindingly wild: it is destructive |
| Catherine’s insincerity and lack of honesty about her love for edgar —> C’s honesty about HC’s flaws shows she accepts him, even his shortcomings | Loss of individual idenity when they are together “I am Heathcliff” |
| C+HC’s love =eternal and transcendent; C+E’s love based on ephemeral, worldly thing, e.g. wealth, status | C+HC’s relationship characterised by the conflict, violence, arguments, etc. It is dysfunctional |
| C’s excitement at HC’s return                                | Catherine is dependant on Heathcliff because they have suffered together, not because she loves him |
| HC’s flaws explored through Nelly’s unreliable narration —> negaive aspects of C+HC told through biased perspective as she supports Edgar over Heathcliff | Catherine is romanticising the ideas of eternal and tragic love (a little like Mishima!!!) |
| More similar                                                 | bronte is proto-feminist, is she really saying that women should be entirely consumed by a male partner and need (“necessary”) him. |
| “Downfall” is C’s ability to become her true self and abandon false attatchment to Edgar | C feels she needs a relationship                             |
| Close relationship and counter to the norm of the victorian marriage convention | Relationship almost incestuous—> dysfunctional and destructive, e.g. Oedipus, Lot |
| Heathcliff is the only person who can handle Catherine. BUT does Catherine need to be handled? ALSO, Linton is very capable. | All relationships are bad with Catherine, almost like her peroson is a Hamartia |
|                                                              | HC abandoned Catherine and retrurns for his own motivations  |
|                                                              |                                                              |
|                                                              |                                                              |
