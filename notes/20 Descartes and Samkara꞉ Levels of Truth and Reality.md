# 20 Descartes and Samkara: Levels of Truth and Reality

https://www.jstor.org/stable/1399157

## Main argument

Western philosophy tends to understand things as either true or false, and that what is real or true is opposite and exclusive to what is unreal or untrue, and that there can be no mediating ground. The quest of Western philosophy has generally been to determine clearly what is real and true contrasted against what is held to be unreal and untrue.

Often in this quest for truth, philosophers tend to qualify truth (hold it to be more or less real, or that something can be more true than another) even while trying to deny and exclude its possibility. Descartes’ method of doubt stratifies and qualifies truth and reality before drawing the lines to begin.



## Samkara’s argument

1. There is one level of full truth/reality and one level of full untruth/unreality. There are at least two other levels “other than real and unreal” between them, which can only be understood in relation to the highest and lowest levels of reality. This ambiguity renders them “that about which we cannot speak”.

2. There are only two kinds of thing fully unreal:

   1. The logical impossibility, e.g. “son of a barren woman” or married bachelor
   2. The thing never met in experience, e.g. a hare’s horn

3. Of the qualified levels of reality, the lowest is pratibhasika. From the higher levels of reality it is unreal, yet the objects are met with in experience so it is not completely unreal. Members are:

   1. Objects of perceptual error, e.g. seeing a snake where one is mistaking a rope for a snake
   2. Hallucinations or magical illusions
   3. Objects experienced in dreams

   - There is an objective and subjective factor in this perceptive error: there is a defect of senses and superimposition of a characteristics onto the present object, but the present object brings its own objective element into the relationship; so there is a real snake which comes into existence, though only qualifiedly and provisionally real.
   - Objects in this level are *sublated* (negated, but preserve a partial element in a synthesis) by a higher level and are temporary. Sublation involves (1) considering the idea the object *appears* as actually exists as it is suggested and then (2) subsequently rejecting this idea through more complete knowledge. The snake is sublated by following perception of the rope

4. The next level of qualified reality, vyavaharika, offers a more adequate picture of reality but is still unreal from the higher levels. Members are objects, logic, and beliefs of everyday waking experience: the rope in the snake-rope, overcoming an illusion, waking up from a dream.

5. The highest level of reality is paramarthika, it is the realm of unqualified ultimate reality (Brahman). At this level, truths of logic and ordinary belief are transcended. It is the reality that underlies the snake-rope while affirming that the snake-rope never existed.

6. Dreams are unreal in that (1) dream experience is sublated by waking consciousness and (2) dreams consist of acts distinguished from immediate waking consciousness by the absence of any real object. Further, dreams do not agree with time, cause, and noncontradiction (a dream can be in one place while the body is in another, time passing differently, things being uncaused, and things contradicting within and outside the dream).

   - However, Samkara’s rational parts of the argument beg the question: there are no real objects in dreams because objects in dreams are not real; and time, place, cause and contradiction in the nature of dreams is not real because they are not real in the nature of dreams.
   - Considering waking reality as a priori real is unjustified on purely logical grounds. The experiential grounds of waking experience relies on the assumption that one awakens from dreams to waking experience, and that waking experience is the criterion for deciding what is real to begin with.
   - It might be just as logically possible that one wakes into dreams from the qualified or provisional reality of waking life. (Indeed, this is how going from sleep to deep sleep is seen)

7. Dreams are real in that (1) they are not unreal in being neither a logical impossibility nor something not experienced, and (2) they sometimes have real effects.

8. Thus dreams are neither totally real nor totally unreal, but a mixture of both. They are “that about which we cannot speak” (anirvacaniya).

9. Humans are under the influence of *maya*, a beginningless phenomenon with no adequate explanation, which causes humans to believe waking experience is the ultimate real. Maya does not so much deceive, but keeps people away from true knowledge and limiting it to things epistemologically and ontologically “second-rate”

10. Samkara notices subjectivity similarly to Descartes, “For everyone is conscious of the existence of Self, and never thinks ‘I am not’.” But carries on to ask the question of the nature of subjectivity. One encounters five levels of Self in attempting to know it, each a deeper level into true Self: the material, vital, mental, intellectual, and blissful.

11. One can only posit a provisionally real god, so long as one is in the third level. As one ascends to the highest, it is revealed to be only the individual soul, in turn revealed as Brahman.

## Relevance to Descartes

Descartes examines the status of (1) perception and error, (2) hallucination and delusion due to madness, and (3) dreams; in an almost exact duplication of Samkara’s description of the pratibhasika level (lowest qualified level).

The discussion of dreams leads to the next level, vyavahrika. He then invokes the evil deceiver to move against the beliefs in mathematical or fundamental propositions.

Descartes notices sense-perception is often mistaken, as they can be easily corrected the level of reality where objects are mistakenly perceived is very low. Descartes uses his own version of sublation in the method of Cartesian doubt: that which is not sublated, and is hence more real, survives the transition. As the objects of perceptual error cannot survive this, Descartes rejects them as an adequate basis.

Samkara addresses the issue of the unreality of dreams, which perhaps Descartes takes for granted and fails to doubt.

Descartes arrives at the mental or intellectual level of the self.

The evil deceiver cannot cause Descartes’ to be wrong of his own existence but—on Samkara’s view—this does not prevent that Descartes is wrong about his true self and what kind of self exists.

For the Trademark argument, as Descartes is still perhaps under the influence of the deceiver, he can only posit an illusory God. Samkara acknowledges one can only posit a provisionally real God, so long as one’s working level of reality is the third. As one ascends to the highest level, it is revealed as nothing other than the individual soul, in turn revealed as Brahman.

## Key quotes

> Although Descartes claims that his is a method of radical and systematic doubt, we should note that, strictly speaking, this is not the case. Instead of simply doubting the truth and reality of his former opinions, he replaces his former opinions about the real and true with his former opinions about the unreal and the untrue. Instead of suspending judgment on any and all experience, he singles out dream experience as a priori unreal and uses it as a negative base against waking experience. This set up an artificial opposition between dream and waking experience: if dream experience is considered real, then waking experience is assumed to be unreal; likewise, if waking experience is held to be real, then dreams are considered unreal. Descartes shuts the door on the possibility of either (1) both waking and dream experience being real, or (2) both waking and dream experience being unreal. When Descartes pretends that he is dreaming, it can show him nothing about the truth and reality of dream or waking experience if either (1) or (2) above holds true. In order to be true to his method of radical doubt, Descartes would have to consider the possibility of both (1) and (2), but Descartes' doubt is not radical enough. He forgets to doubt the unreality of his dreams.

> It seems just as logically possible, though perhaps counter-intuitive, that one "wakes" into dreams from the qualified or provisional reality of waking life.

> Descartes uses his God to reassert what he had naively believed all along. The levels of reality discovered and employed in the method of ascertaining the nature of truth and reality dissolve into a dichotomy as the beneficence of God reveals the truth and reality of God, minds, and the material universe and the unreality and falsity of dreams, illusions, and perceptual error. Samkara, on the other hand, posits a level of truth and reality for dreams, illusions, and perceptual error, as well as a higher level of reality and truth for normal waking experience. Besides this, Samkara goes beyond even the methodological levels of reality employed by Descartes to discover a God beyond God, a truth beyond truth, and a reality beyond reality.
