# 14 Cottingham, *Descartes on "Thought"*
M2
> What am I then? A thing which thinks? What is that? A thing which doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wills, is unwilling, and also imagines and feels

Cottingham will look at the reasons behind Descartes' use of the term 'thought' (cogitatio, la penseÃ©)

## I
Cottingham rejects the influential account that the use of thought at the time of Descartes was much wider and included will, feeling, judgement, perceptions, etc., not just mental acts and data.

It is clear that cogitare was widely used in this extended sense, but it is very possible the Cartesian corpus was the driving force behind this.

The scholastic tradition, however, made a clear distinction between cogitative (mental acts and data and appetitive (willing). So the common followers of Aquinas' influence would not have accepted that "res cogitans" (thinking) implied "res volens" (willing).

So it may not have been clear that Descartes' use was self evident or common at the time.

Common misconceptions:
cogito = thinking
thought = wider thought
thinking = thought

What the cogito *should* be understood as:
conscientia: consciousness/awareness, "inescapably cognitive"


## II

> 'thought' is inseparable from his nature is, like his discovery of the certainty of his own existence, inextricably bound up with a strictly cognitive process---the method of doubt

(Cottingham, )

The way sum res cogitans is arrived at suggests and intellectualistic interpretation of cogitare.
The indubitability of "I think" consists precisely in that doubting it entails its truth. So far, the thinking thing is a being that thinks in the ordinary, strictly cognitive sense

## III
Defintion of thought
> In the term thought I include everything which is in us in such a way that we are immediately aware of it. Thus all the operations of the will, intellect, imagination and senses are thoughts."

Second Replies

>  By the term 'thought' I understand everything which happens in our conscious selves, in so far as there is awareness of it in us.

Principles

cogitare a *reflective* act of the mind.

Children have "confused perceptions", we cannot remember the thoughts of early infancy not because they don't think, but because it is confused. Also, this thinking is self-reflective (or at least, D does not deny this)

## IV
A true cogitatio is only so in the sense that it involves reflective mental awareness.

Sensations are a "confused mode of thinking" and perceptions a "special mode of thinking".

There is an intermingling between mind with corporeal substance, so we *feel* damage, not just *observe* them.
This is how one would expect it to be for a res cogitans. Angels, pure res cogitans, would only observe motions if in a human.
Therefore:
1. A human body is not a pure res cogitans, it is a res cogitans mysteriously united with a body
2. Much of a human's mental life nonetheless consists of pure cogitationes (the cognitive intellectual operations a disembodied spirit might enjoy)
3. However, perceptions (seeing) and feelings (pain) are not *cogitationes simpliciter*, but "confused perceptions". Made up of
  a. The reflective awareness of the perceptions and feelings
  b. The residual part from the senses, a "qualitative feel" (the painfulness of pain), which remains mysterious.

So, the proposition "I *am* in pain" cannot be clearly and distinctly known. To be a CDP it must be *nothing but what is clear*, of which the residual part cannot come in.
We could only have the CDP of being in pain if we remove the residual feel and only keep the purely reflective element; if we "take great care not to include in our judgement anything more than that which is contained in our perceptions".

## V
Descartes' inclusion of willing, perceiving, feeling, etc. under the cogitatio is a deliberate decision.
It is not simply an arbitrary extension of usage, it requires careful analysis:
- The various operations of the res cogitans/cogitatio are *cogitationes* only and precisely in so far as they include a reflective cognitive act---the mind's intellectual awareness of itself which D terms *conscientia*.

However, the argued indubitability of "Thinking" being unable to be torn from my nature as doubting comfirms it does not imply the incorrigibility of judgements with processes D proceeds to list of the res cogitans. There is no reason why the demon could not deceive me into thinking that I wanted to desire something.

D's reasoning relies on that we can isolate the reflective awareness of some datum (it still *seems* tgat I am wanting, or seeing, there can be no doubt about this) which there can be no doubt of.

However, this relies on a (dubious) thesis of the "perfect transparency of the mind".

To conclude, the common denominator of dubito on one hand, and volo, sentio, etc. on the other does not justify the move from "sum res cogitans" to "sum res volens, sentiens, etc.". 

The most that D's doubt could allow him to assert as essential to his nature is that---in the narrowest sense---he thinks
