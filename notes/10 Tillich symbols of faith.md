# 10 Tillich symbols of faith

## Chapter 3: Symbols of Faith

Humanity’s ultimate concern must be symbolically expressed

***Equivocal***

### Symbols

Have one common characteristic with signs: they point beyond themselves to something else

- The red sign at a street corner points to the order to stop movement of cars
- Letters, numbers and (partly) words also do this

- Signs do not participate in the reality they point to, symbols do
- Signs can be replaced for expediency or convention, symbols cannot

Symbols participate in that which to they point

- Flag participates in power and dignity of the nation it represents
- Therefore they cannot be replaced
- An attack on the symbol is considered an attack on what it represents

Symbols open up otherwise-closed levels of reality

- All arts create symbols for a level of reality which can’t otherwise be reached
- A picture and poem approach reality in a way scientific methods cannot

Symbols unlock dimensions and elements of the soul which correspond to reality

- A great play both gives us a new vision of the human scene and opens hidden depths of our own being
- There are dimensions within us we are only made aware of through symbols

Symbols cannot be intentionally produced/accepted

- They grow out of individual or collective unconscious
- They cannot function without being accepted by the unconscious of our being
- Symbols with social functions have to be accepted by the collective unconscious

Symbols cannot be invented or killed, they require a context. 

- Symbols grow and die like living beings, given the circumstances they are in
- The symbol of the king grew in a particular scene and died in most parts of the world at a different time
- Symbols die because they can no longer produce response in the group where they originally found expression
  - They do not die because of scientific or practical criticism
  - They do not grow out of people longing for them

### Religious Symbols

Why can the ultimate concern not be directly and properly expressed? If money, success, or the nation is someone’s ultimate concern, can’t this be said without symbolic language

Because anything which is a matter of unconditional concern is made into a type of god. If the nation is the ultimate concern, it is given divine qualities and a sacred name which surpasses the being, and functioning of the nation in reality.

The nation stands for and symbolises the true ultimate, in an idolatrous way.

Ultimate concern of success is not valuing actualised potentialities, but readiness to sacrifice everything else for a position of power and social dominance. Anxiety about this is idolatrous anxiety about divine condemnation. Success becomes grace; lack of success becomes condemnation.

It is in the character of ultimacy and nature of faith to do this transformation of concepts too symbols.

The true ultimate transcends realms of finite reality. No finite reality can express this directly and properly.

Religiously, God transcends his own name. That’s why use of it is a blasphemy. What we say is the ultimate concern, regardless if we call it God or not, has a symbolic meaning: it points beyond itself while participating with that.

The language of faith is the language of symbols. If faith wasn’t this, assertions about the ultimate wouldn’t be possible.

Symbolic language surpasses in strength non-symbolic language.

The fundamental symbol of our ultimate concern is God. This is always present, even if the concern is the denial of God; God can only be denied in the name of God. One god can deny the other one. Ultimate concern cannot deny itself.

Therefore, atheism is the attempt to remove such an ultimate concern, to remain unconcerned about the nature of one’s existence.

To claim ultimate concern is denying God affirms God. Because this affirms ultimacy, and ultimacy is God.

What is God a symbol for? God is a symbol for God. In God there is the notion of

- ultimacy: immediate experience and not symbolic in itself 
- concreteness: taken from ordinary experience and symbolically applied

Ultimate concern of sacred tree

- ultimacy concern contains both ultimacy and concreteness of tree’s symbolic relation to the ultimate

Of Apollo

- ultimate concern symbolised in Apollo’s divine image

Of Yahweh

- ultimate concern and concrete image of this concern

God is the fundamental content of faith.



Discussion about God’s existence or non-existence is meaningless. It is meaningless to question the ultimacy of an ultimate concern. The element in the idea of God is itself certain.

If existence refers to something found in the whole of reality then no divine being exists. This is not the question, but: which of the symbols of faith is most adequate to express it/ which expresses ultimate concern without idolatry.

Finite experience is applied symbolically beyond finitude and infinity. Faith uses the human experience of, say, power to symbolise the content of infinite concerns. Qualities and actions we attribute to God are symbols taken from daily experience, not information of what God did or will do. Faith isn’t belief in these things, but acceptance of symbols that express ultimate concern.

Another group of symbols are manifestations of the divine in the finite real. Holy things are not holy in themselves, but point to something beyond themselves to the source of holiness and ultimate concern.

### Symbols and Myths

Symbols do not appear in isolation. Myths are symbols of faith combined in stories about divine-human encounters. Myths are the language of faith in the symbol.

The reason for criticism of myth is the nature of it: it takes the divine and uses material from ordinary experience, and divides the divine into several without removing individual claim to ultimacy.

Criticism of myth rejects this division of the divine and goes beyond to a single divine. Even one God is mythologised, when “spoken about is drawn into the framework of time and space.” Monotheism also requires demythologisation. If this means recognising symbols as symbol and myths as myths it should be supported.

If demythologisation means removing symbols and myths, it should be opposed. Symbol and myth are part of the human consciousness. You can replace one myth with another but can’t remove myth from spiritual life, myth is a combination of symbols of our ultimate concern.

Mythological elements in the Bible, doctrine, and liturgy must be recognised as mythological but maintained in their symbolic form.

Primitive mythological consciousness attempts to resist interpreting myth as myth, they resist the attempt to recognise symbols as symbols.

> The character of the symbol to point beyond itself to something else is disregarded. The fall of Adam is localized to a specific geographical point and attributed to a specific human individual. The virgin birth of the Messiah is understood in biological terms, resurrection and ascension as physical events, the second coming of Christ as a telluric, or cosmic, catastrophe. The presupposition of such literalism is that God is a being, acting in time and space, dwelling in a special place, affecting the course of events and being affected by them like any other being in the universe. Literalism deprives God of his ultimacy and, religiously speaking, of his majesty.

Not recognising the symbolic language lowers God to the non ultimate, the finite and conditional.

Faith taking its symbols literally becomes idolatrous.

There are two types of literalism:

- natural: mythical and literal are indistinguishable, this is the primitive moment in the development of faith. This has a full right of its own until the moment when the questioning breaks apart natural acceptance of the myth as literal
- reactive: demands that the myth be broken, though this doesn’t always happen
  - half-aware of the question but represses it because the questioning force is too weak, or there is a conscious repression and aggression towards autonomous thought

Conscious reactive literalism is the enemy of critical theology.

Symbols of faith can’t be replaced by other symbols, they have as unique a standing as science and art has, and cannot be removed by scientific criticism.

There are natural and historical myths, Christianity might not be bound to natural myths, but speaks the language of mythology like every other religion. It is a broken myth, but a myth. Otherwise Christianity would not be an expression of the true ultimate
