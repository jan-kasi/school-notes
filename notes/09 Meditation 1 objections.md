# 09 Meditation 1 objections


## O3: Hobbes
Objection:

Reply:
Descartes needs to include the description so that the solution is complete and makes sense, Descartes claims he wants to show the entirety of the problem which he will solve.

## O7: Bourdin
Objection:

Reply:
We are the madmen, so Descartes will doubt and try to explain knowledge 

- "Some care"---Descartes is basically telling Bourdin to read the rest of the meditations
- CDP --- clear and distinct perceptions, true objective knowledge
  - but why are CDP knowledge?

## Doubt
In the replies, Descartes clarifies the
1. Scope of his skepticism
2. The extent to which he believes reason plays a part in knowledge
3. The deeper intention behind his arguments (especially in comparison to Plato)

## Empiricism

Is doubting reason self-defeating?
Painting analogy: it appears D preserves belief in shape/extension/sound etc, however this is then called into doubt by the Evil Demon---even the most basic truths might be wrong

Two concerns arise:
1. If the demon hypothesis can cast doubt on basic ideas, then should it not cast doubt on our capacity to make basic logical inferences? (e.g. the inference that a supremely good God would not deceive us about mathematics) Surely this must mean we must doubt the operation of reason itself; or then use doubt, to doubt doubt.
  - Further, could not this all be a total trick, something in itself which the demon is creating---reason is something deceived
  - however, you are using reason to reach a conclusion about the falsity of reason
    - exactly, reason can take you in any direction, and you cannot know anything or talk meaningfully
2. What if the evil demon's deception is so good that it is indistinguishable from "actual reality". Is there any real sense in which something can meaningfully be called "fake" when it is indistinguishable as the "real thing", the Law of Indiscernibles. If it is so perfect, can we really call it fake? e.g. perfect forgery of a Â£10 note
  - If Descartes' demon can create the perfect illusion then surely it is identical to what we call reality?
  - Therefore the demon hypothesis is empty
    - But does this not assume reality must be a perfect copy?
    - Further, they are different in that one is made by a demon
      - But, we can never know this. WE will never be able to discern
        - difference in ontology and epistemology, do we know something because it is named or name it because we know it

## Locke
*An Essay on Human Understanding*
- Innate knowledge is either (1) something we consciously have or (2) something we all have the capacity to receive. Both are nonsense for Lock
- "No proposition can be said to be in the mind, which it never yet knew, which it never yet was conscious of"
  - you must KNOW it, you cannot have it and know it but not know it and then know it
- "all the truths a man ever comes know, will, by this account, be every one of them, innate
  - if innate knowledge is received, then all knowledge is innate as all knowledge can be received
- Either (1) innate knowledge is nothing or (2) innate knowledge is everything

There is no innate knowledge
