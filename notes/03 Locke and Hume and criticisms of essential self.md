# 03 Locke and Hume and criticisms of essential self
Hume: justification for bundle theory 

 

Following Hume's theory of knowledge, for the self to be real the idea of self must be properly derived from some impressions and perceptions (the empirical part of Hume). But, because the self asserted which Hume is arguing against is 1. unchanging, and 2. makes/references every idea from it, the impression it is derived of must also be unchanging. But impressions are not, they are constantly changing as products of sense perception. There is no such impression and can't be one unchanging impression/idea which everything else is referencing itself from.  

Therefore, the self can't be derived from the things which make up knowledge and can't exist as a part of knowledge. i.e. it is not real. 

 

The justification for going on to consider some other explanation is that there are perceptions which we consider as "having" them, and the things which self tried to explain. So Hume then considers what it actually is. 

 

"For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other... I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception." T 1.4.6.3. 

Considering what this idea of self actually is leads to think of experience of many perceptions and no experience of such a self. 

The self is not a real thing as a part of knowledge or derivable as a real thing using knowledge, but these things still exist in a non-self way. So there's a justification for believing the bundle theory because of rejecting the idea of a self, as there seems to be a required explanation of the things left behind. 

 

The empirical basis is his knowledge theory, and because the self isn't real it can't receive empirical or knowledge proof, further because Hume wants to give an explanation for the things which the self previously tried to explain. 

 

Proof that "herd" is actually a bundle of sheep and not an object/thing itself is like it. You can't really empirically prove that an object "herd" exists, it isn't a thing which is real; it is real as a word/description, not as a *thing*. You can show that you can't empirically hold that "herd" is a real existing thing. 

But, you can point to *a* herd and say, "that's a herd," and, "there is a sheep, which is part of a herd". So you provide an explanation that a herd is really just a word describing a collection of sheep. Proof that "herd" is what you say it is comes from showing what is meant by "heard" when you describe it, and the empirical reason for believing this is that it being a real thing isn't true. 

 

I don't think it's an accurate criticism to argue he gives no reason to believe in bundle theory, or that his argument goes against his empiricism or knowledge-theory/ has no foundation in his empiricism. Because the empirical foundation is kind of his justification and method for arriving at bundle theory to begin with, and the rejection of a real self. Believing the bundle theory is justified by the requirement of some explanation of what, if the self isn't real, all these things we previously explained and considered as a self are. 

 

You can accuse Hume of begging the question to some extent though, he almost pre-defines the self (like with the herd), but it's a hard argument to make I think. 

 

You can also deny the proof that there is no self and provide an alternative. 

 

Another criticism is of how knowledge works or an alternate idea of a real-self which somehow works inside Hume's ideas of knowledge; or to provide an alternative explanation for the leftovers than the bundle theory. 

 

You could also object that Hume doesn't provide a thorough explanation of *how* these things are bundled together, just that they are when you think of them. 

 

There's quite a lot of issues with bundle theory for me, but I don't think Hume goes against his empirical framework and I do think he gives good reason for bundle theory within his philosophy as an explanation for the things previously explained by self. In my very tired opinion anyway. 

 

Hume also says that if anyone genuinely reflects and finds a different self than this, then he can't apply this reasoning to them and allows that they might be right about themselves and there may be a fundamental difference. So this could be an area for criticism maybe. 

 

 

Crude example: 

The self is like saying: ((gloob is the set of "blue coloured birds"; and)) the "gloob" is it's own thing, separate from "blue coloured birds", existing as a thing in the real world, it is the source for whatever-it-is-self-is-can't-remember. 

The gloob can't be empirically verified as a thing because there isn't an actual being of gloob. Gloob is just an _idea_, a  name for a collection of things as a lazy way to say "blue coloured birds", not a real thing. 

That's why gloob can't be empirically verified like a table, not because it has different metaphysical properties which make it some immaterial, special thing. 

 

The furthest to provide empirical proof that gloob is a collection and not a real thing, assuming everyone forgot the definition of the gloob and you accept Hume's ideas of knowledge, is: 

 

1. point out that you can't empirically verify or experience the gloob, and it can't be proven as a part of knowledge 

2. Therefore gloob isn't real, or at least not in the way it is claimed to be 

3. When you try and describe what the gloob is, and consider it genuinely, you end up describing: "set of blue coloured birds" 

4. Therefore, gloob is just a word which means "set of blue coloured birds", and the gloob is just a set of blue coloured birds. It isn't an actual thing, it doesn't exist like a table does. 

(5. if you test this understanding of gloob, it makes sense with [1.], because you can't empirically verify or experience the collection itself, but you can experience the things inside the collection; it makes sense with [2], because such a collection isn't a real empirical thing in the world, so it doesn't exist as a thing)
