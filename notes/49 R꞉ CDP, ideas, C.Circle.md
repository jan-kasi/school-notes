# 49 R꞉ CDP, ideas, C.Circle

p29 "But what about..." to end of p30

3 Categories of thought:
1. Ideas
2. The Will and volitions/emotions
- A volition is a change within you which you can't control (an emotion/desire), but you can control their expressions.
- The Will is a God-given free capacity to choose
3. Judgements

CDP
p31 "But the chief question at this point concerns the ideas which I take to be derived from things existing outside me: what is my reason for thinking that they resemble these things?"

The Will is the capacity of the mind to freely choose what to believe.

The Natural Light/Light of Reason is the faculty of intuition (intellectual seeing) aided by the light of rationality. i.e. it gives truths which are clear and (if not confused with any of the other ideas) distinct.

Intuition is a special form of judgement, something which is felt to be true and judged to be so

CDP = those which can be intuited by the mind by means of reason alone

Descartes' Replies to his contemporary Cartesian Circle objection.
p130-135

His Ontological argument effectively means that "God exists" can be known intuitively, containing his own existence and power to exist. This can be anachronistically labelled as being an analytic statement. This means that God exists is known independently of CDP, and God's self proving/containing existence grounds/provides a guarantee for the veracity of CDPs.

Atheist challenge response: p131

cognitio = awareness of something (e.g. light bends)
scientia = systematic, grounded knowledge = how, when, why...
