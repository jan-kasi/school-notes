## Should robots have rights? Why or why not?

The question of this essay becomes more pressing with rapid development in general artificial intelligence and related areas, such as advanced perception-sensors and natural language processing. With the approaching possibility of discovering how far technology can truly go, perhaps a new conception of rights must emerge, similar to past advancements in rights theory to include animals. I attempt to form a new possible framework of rights for which to analyse at what point robots should morally have rights.



Rights can be defined as claims to act in some way or against another’s behaviour, directly related to some duty (Fieser n.d.). Husserl argues that the body is a lived “here”, a centre for movement structures, felt sensations, and subjective experience. Motility—capacity for self-movement—is an essential part of embodied consciousness and enables an “I can” or “I cannot” for the body (Behnke n.d.). This ability to chose and do something is what a right affects, therefore self-rights affect the body’s motility. For rights about another’s behaviour to one, these affect the right-holder’s body—being a lived centre—so primarily influence ability to do or have something done as experienced through and by the right-holder’s body. It follows that rights primarily affect motility in some way, or at the very least are primarily focused with the body.



Notwithstanding, a right cannot be focused on directly affecting the mind. While there may be rights about mental states, a right to believe or feel a certain way, they protecting these mental states by focusing on guaranteeing external behaviours. One cannot focus this right on the mind, only as a guarantee that the body will not be interfered with: the body’s motility towards these mental states  allows for this ability to begin with and, regardless of body-mind positions, interference with mental states goes through the body. For physicalism, the body is interfered with so the generated mental-states are protected. For idealism, the mind-projected body, entangled with conscious experience, is affected so the mind generating it is guaranteed the mental states. In dualism, the vessel for activity done and done to is the body; there are issues with the mind-body problem in suggesting a mental state could directly affect someone else’s without the body, and how a physical activity of someone else could directly interfere with the right-holder’s mental states. Dualist solutions to the mind-body interaction problem fail to provide this answer. Interactionism offers a solution between one person’s mental and physical substances, there is no explanation of how a mental state of one person could influence another’s without interacting through the physical; epiphenomenalism concedes my point, a physical thing causes the mental-state; in parallelism the two run in harmony, but even though there is no relation there is no ability for a right to focus on the mind as action is through the body (Robinson 2020).



Quinn writes that “a person is constituted by his body and mind […] it is fitting that he have a primary say over what may be done to them”, so rights rise out of recognition of the holder’s existence as an independent being and specific composition (Quinn 1993, 170). It is not necessary for these to be separate or one substance, simply that the person contain instances of such states. Quinn holds that rights are respected because it is fitting to do so and not because of consequences, this is a status theory for the justification of rights: the nature of the holder determines if they have rights (Wenar 2020). I find consequentialist instrumental justifications don’t answer the question of who deserves rights, only why they should be respected. By requiring one to qualify for rights this issue is answered, the consequentialist position can be held together. It would follow that if someone’s nature has mental and physical states and motility which the rights can affect, they qualify to deserve rights. The question then is not if there is some mental substance within a robot or proven consciousness, but if the robot has this lived body containing such states which by nature deserves it rights. 



While the mind is not the target of rights, the body is a centre for kinaesthetic consciousness. This body discussed is therefore intrinsically linked to some consciousness, a non-conscious physical thing might have a body in that it is a physical thing in the world, but it is not a *lived* body. Merleau-Ponty notes that we are our bodies, that “existence as subjectivity is merely one with existence as a body and existence of the world […] the subject that I am […] is inseparable from this body and this world” (Merleau-Ponty 1966, 408). This observation that consciousness, existence as subjectivity, is inseparable from the body and from the world adds a further layer to complexity of what is deserving of rights. The intrinsic link between consciousness and body entails that the conscious must have a lived body, but not that the body is lived or conscious. This doesn’t have to be interpreted in a materialist way, the mental states of life can be contained within another form of body, an “enriched” body or “incarnate” mind which is able to think and perceive (Reynolds n.d.). This is similar to Husserl’s conception to the body, and I find both ideas to be compatible for my purposes; the body which is the focus of rights, then, is a body through which thought and mental capacity come and is a centre for kinaesthetic consciousness and the subjective experience.



One might question this interpretation of rights with an argument with marginal cases. It seems  a quadriplegic has no such motility, if rights are based on this and protect motility then a quadriplegic  has no body which is deserving of rights and nothing which a right could protect, thus none; this seems intuitively wrong. However, while the body is the focus of rights and motility is the effect, someone not moving still has a lived body inseparable from subjective experience. A right can affect another person’s motility’s effects on the right-holder’s body, therefore there are cases in which a right is focused on the right-holder’s body and affects another’s motility. A paraplegic has no “right” in a moral claim to be able to move, as it is not possible to begin with, but the lived body deserving of rights doesn’t need motility to deserve other rights. It only needs to be a lived body, which the quadriplegic's is. I find that the solution applies equally to other marginal cases, such as severe dementia.



Initially, this solution may present a problem for the question of a robot’s rights. If the requirement is that the body be a lived body then how to determine what has a body is an issue. Perhaps there is also another marginal case: an unconscious person. Beauvoir recognises that existence has a necessary condition of “a body that is both a thing of the world and a point of view on this world”, so it is not a case that someone existent in this world would not have a body, though “nothing requires […] this or that particular structure” (Beauvoir 2011, 44). There’s no reason that a robot or artificial intelligence—both have at least *a* body, they would be existent—should not have rights if it has some centre and view on the world, a *lived* body, however dissimilar its structure is to our idea of a conscious living body, but a reason for it *to have* rights. Nagel writes that the “subjective character of experience”, “something that it is like to *be*” is what constitutes consciousness (Nagel 1974). In the case of an unconscious being, then there would something it is like to be that being when it is conscious, and the body of this consciousness is still the same existent body. Therefore, this body would be deserving of rights—almost as owned property has rights protecting it for the owner when away, in this case being an owner of itself, self-sovereignty of the lived body making itself its own property. The rights which would apply might be rights kept on from before unconsciousness; or, new rights of the unconscious body *for* a possible future conscious-body.



The problem of other minds and philosophical zombies may not prove to be issues. There may be no reason to doubt that  “anything complex enough to behave like a person would have experiences” (Nagel 1974). While there’s no test to identifying if something has qualia of subjective character of experience, it is reasonable to assume that something behaving as a lived body *is* a lived body: the ability to imitate this perhaps even necessitates actually having the qualities of a lived body, and therefore be one. Withal, while we may not be able to verify consciousness, there is no moral loss for granting something superfluous-rights but there *is* for not granting deserved-rights.



Concluding, a robot would deserve rights when it achieves a lived body, any indication of having this lived body would be enough. Notwithstanding that imitating a lived body might be impossible, showing any indication of a lived body is the same treatment one uses for others who deserve rights. This analysis of rights in respect to lived body provides an initial framework to evaluate when a robot might deserve rights, avoiding a moral loss of not granting them. Because of this, it might be desirable and perhaps more responsible, to build robots removed from this possibility.
