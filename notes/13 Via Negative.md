# 13 Via Negative

## Statements
"God is not evil" -> Rejecting the idea that God's essence contains evil
"God is good" -> Rejecting the idea that God's essence contains evil, God's essence doesn't *contain* goodness, but the statement doesn't say this.
In making a positive affirmation, it implicitly negates the opposite. The affirming statement is a reworded negation about God's essence.

"God is love"
