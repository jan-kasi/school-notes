# 15 Later Wittgenstein

Later Wittgenstein, language games.

## *Philosophical Investigations*, 1953

Wants to “disabuse” us of these misconceptions about meaning:

1. The meaning of a word is the object it stands for
   1. If a word means something it refers to an object in the world, table means the table I wrote this on

2. The meaning of a word is a private mental state (Lockean conception)
   1. A word means something it refers to in a mental state, table means the idea of table I had in my head

Early
- Words are like to be viewed as pictures representing a state of affairs, like pictorial representation.
- In language we present in words what we might otherwise paint in a painting.
Wittgenstein rejects this later
### Later

Rejects the picture theory of language in favour of a more open-ended and perhaps commonsense view of language

> For a large class of cases—though not for all—in which we employ the word ‘meaning’ it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language

Words are determined by their role in the broader language.
Understanding meaning of language requires underdtanding the rules of the game.

Language is:
Non-cognitive
Anti-reliast

- language can have meaning in different ways on different levels
- words can indicate more than one idea at the same time, and can mean different things in different contexts
- language changes and develops in time
- language is expressed in different games in different groups/contexts
