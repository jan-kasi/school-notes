# 44 Q: The use of philosophy rather than theology

a. Explain Descartes' view that the two questions respecting God and the Soul ought to be determined by the help of philosophy rather than theology
b. Evaluate Descartes' view that the two questions respecting God and the Soul ought to be determined by the help of philosophy rather than theology

## A
Lines of inquiry
1. Introduction
  -  Dedicatory letter: Descartes' claim about using philosophy rather than theology to address the areas of God and the Soul, justifying both its validity and its attempt through a theological claim. Descartes' attempts to build a firm foundation for all knowledge which can be certain, underwriting this with positions on the nature of the Soul, or mind, and include a clause for the certainty of God. The believer can "accept on faith" God and the Soul, therefore theological demonstrations which are dependent on faith are sufficient; but the unbeliever does not have the faith required, therefore the argument appears circular to them. Philosophy, for Descartes, builds a demonstration using reason and indubitable premises which cannot but be accepted. Therefore, philosophy is a more suitable vessel to address God and the Soul, as the theological goal of convincing the unbeliever can only be done through this. Similarly, a certain foundation for the unbeliever is important to establish that certainty of God.
2. CDP
  - The set of things which Descartes' philosophy builds itself on, these would be assented to by believers and unbelievers alike as they are indubitable.
  - True "by the natural light". Explain idiomatic expression. True by the faculty of intuition aided by the light of rationality, a CDP is believed to be true by the capacity to perceive in the mind and reason allowing one to notice its truth by minimal interaction of the Will.
  - Similarly to faith, these are simply accepted to be true; they differ however in that one cannot chose to believe, while one can chose to have faith.
  - Additionally, CDP allow one to enter into premises which cannot be doubted. Through the Deceiving Demon hypothesis, however, the unbeliever cannot gain any knowledge towards the TRUTH of a CDP. The unbeliever can only know that they cannot doubt this CDP; the demonstration of God is therefore necessary for certainty of CDP's truth and a foundation which can give truth, not simply assent.
3. Causal (trademark+contingency), Ontological
  - Using these CDPs and indubitable premises, as well as the self-verifying thought of the cogito and res cogitans.
  - An inquiry into what one is reveals one is a Mind
  - The ideas this mind has must come from something (Causal Adequacy)
  - Idea of the infinite, held by me (regardless of belief in God), points to an infinite being placing a trademark of the infinite within me
  me. Contingency then points to me being created and preserved by this infinite being, not simply this infinite being existing
  -  Ontological argument then allows for a self-evident God from this initial awareness of the idea that this God exists. The idea of a perfect God leads to holding the necessary existence being the essence of the idea of God. Combined with causal argument, this lends to the necessary existence of a God in possibility and also the causa sui God allowing God to cause himself.
4. The nature of Mind
  - cogito linked in CDP, perhaps put this before Causal/Ontological line of inquiry.
  - The mind cannot be proven to the non believer theologically (link to dedicatory letter). The mind is linked to God in that God is known through the mind and it is possible to determine the existence of the mind separate to God.
  - However God is necessary for the mind to advance beyond itself.

## B
Descartes has theology underwriting his philosophy, thus fails to explain through only philosophy/to the unbeliever regardless of the validity of his argument.
This would be the line running through the lines of inquiry.

For proofs of God, the idea of a perfect being creating perfectly and the inherited Catholic view of God.
For mind, questioning the dependence on God. Bounded doubt instead of unbounded doubt, and argument if this would truly achieve the aim of convincing the unbeliever.
Theology underwrites the ability to know through mind. Natural light and Will.
