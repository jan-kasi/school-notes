# Express Argument


point --> justification/evidence --> explanation/justification

explanation --- why your point is true

x is y because z (point and evidence/justification), which does p so it is y (explanation).

explanation shows the connection and thinking/reasoning

explanation makes your reasoning and thinking clear to the examiner/others.
this should be:
- relevant (point, by using question. evidence, referring to the point)
- accurate (evidence, explanation)
- detailed (evidence, exlpanation)

the explanation shows the philosophical assumptions and reasoning used to make the evidence relevant to and accurate to point and held belief

you can use this when doing discursive analysis, the explanation shows the assumptions which you can criticise. this also shows that your knowledge is accurate and detailed, that you understand what you're talking about

explanation and analysis:
- positives and negatives in the explanation/linked justification allows you to have more areas of evaluation
- this shows a deeper level of understanding of what you're evaluating, not just the superficial level of the argument but the underlying things it is based on,

- e.g. you don't go after cosmological argument, you go after concept of infinity, causation, premises' links to conclusion (inductive)

- you can unpack things in greater detail. compartamentalising the areas of argument allow you to do well developed critical analysis. undermine the foundation and columns and individual parts, not the whole building in one go.



make thinking visible


## e.g. design qua regularity

- we observe regularity
- things have a final cause/purpose
- purpose means design

1. everything we observe follows some laws of nature/ everything has regularity
2. this means there is intention
3. which means there is design, so a designer

regularity cannot occur without design (assumption)
regularity exists (causation)
regularity occurs everywhere (induction)

point: things appear to follow regular/ consistent laws in the universe
evidence: such as gravity, cycles in natural world
explanation: therefore demonstates existence of god. as there cannot be regularity without design. so there is a designer, who is god. consistency does not come about by chance. leaning on inductive reasoning and synthetic a posteriori knowledge. applies inductive resaoning to a posteriori knowledge to form a synthetic a posteriori claim.
