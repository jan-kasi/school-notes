# 01 Initial Archetypes 
Rooster as a Robin Hood-like figure
- living in woods with a band of "merry men"
- outside society
- "giving" to the poor
as a Jesus-like figure?
- outside society
- with a band of followers
- harassed by authorities

But Rooster subverts these too, or fulfills them in an unexpected way.





- same setting as Midsummernight's dream
  - professor comes in and starts yelling about Titania
- setting of As You Like It
# 02 Initial antitheses
- The council+police and Rooster
  - order, law, clearly defined v. sporadic/disorder, unlawful/crime, undefined
  - predictability v. unpredictability
  - *order v. disorder* Rex Gibson: Order and Disorder are a constant feature of every Shakespearean play. Can also be applied here
- Wesley denying and Rooster admitting
- Wesley realistic Rooster unrealistic
- Professor and Ginger
  - "madness" and "sanity"
  - educated but stupid and uneducated but sensible
- truth and false/un truths
- authority and rebellion
- rural and urban
  - natural v. development, a new privately owned housing estate is being built
  - gentrification
  - opposite to Rooster's home
- freedom and restriction
  - even with appearance of freedom (Wesley)
  - responsibility and irresponsibility
  

- inside and outside society

- mainstream and alternative
- place: austraila vs wiltshore
  - Davy vs Lee
  - Localism almost to extent of xenophobia
# 03 Act 1

The Holy Fool:
- Out of society but become asociated with some holy wisdom by others
- E.g. St Basil in Russia (?)

perhaps Rooster in some way. But more so the holy fool of the people, he may not have any wisdom i.e. it is the others who make Rooster a holy fool in some way

A slight cult of personality around Rooster?

Rooster has the fool's licence: he is able to say things because he is "just pissing about" and speaking nonesense, otherwise he wouldn't be able to.

The fool in King Lear: the fool stops being tolerated and is never heard of again, Rooster has stopped being tolerated by the Council. However, Rooster is never wanted (unlike the fool) he is simply tolerated.


## Literary/mythological allusions
- Robin Hood
- St George and the Dragon
- King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table
- Phaedra: mythology
- Byron - Lord Byron: Romantic Poet (known as a wild man, outrageous life)
- Midsummer Night's Dream, Henry IV (Falstaff)
- Jerusalem - William Blake
- Fagin (Oliver Twist)

Butterworth rejects intentionally including allusion other than St George and the Dragon, but does not reject different interpretations.
- maybe inherited knowledge/collective unconscious though. so hehe
- idea of archetypes

He also rejects the play being a "State of England" play. (but you could maybe argue it has become one? idk)

"I think Blake's song and my play are both celebrations and lamentations at the same time of a lost state" (because of the title "Jerusalem")

# E1: A1 Byron presentation
### Discuss the presentation of Rooster Byron in Act 1 of Jerusalem.

Butterworth presents Rooster Byron to the audience as an oxymoron: he is both distasteful and amoral yet a lovable character with a sense of a personal honour. Representing the contrast between archetype and reality, the analysis of Rooster as a character enables the audience to comprehend the failures of social structures and the irony inherent in them. Thus these oppositions serve as a hook for a deconstruction of what the viewer takes as reality.

From the very beginning, Butterworth’s stage directions indicate the playwright's authorial intent to characterise Rooster as the overwhelmed resistance to social oppression. The imagery of an “old Wessex flag” and “‘Waterloo’” sign are one of the first glimpses the audience receives of Rooster’s character. By first showing his surroundings, Butterworth allows the reader to gauge an insight into Rooster’s psyche before his first appearance.

The setting of “England at midnight…in a moonlit wood” combines with the symbolism of the Wessex flag—representative of one of the original kingdoms in Anglo-Saxon England—as a picture of national cultural history, to create a nostalgic sense of the past and an almost fairy tale-esque archetypal setting. This may have generated a psychological association to this concept in the audience’s access to the collective unconscious, but by juxtaposing this with the “deafening bass” the night before we see this properly and “Lots of junk” littering the scene afterwards, Butterworth subverts the expectation before it is fully formed. This immediately creates a conflict of what we do not expect to be the archetype of a fable being one in some way, and yet polluted by “American” litter.

The association of Waterloo with a great victory over a mighty military power further sets the scene for Rooster to be perhaps a General against invasion or oppression. The introduction of Fawcett and Parsons as representatives of the oppressive state with a bureaucratic and self-righteous attitude just before the audience’s first sense of who Byron is further builds this expectation.

The explicitly Americanised litter however recreates a nationalistic sentiment of aversion towards the apparent cultural imperialism of the United States by how even its “old American-style fridge[s]” have invaded the otherwise perfect and Romantic idea of a natural state of beauty, the English forest. In a way, the audience registers that this battle against state oppression is a futile one which has already been lost by the forming of a cultural hegemony.

This build-up creates a startling confusion for the audience upon the actual first introduction of Rooster. After the “dog” interrupting the state-representatives, “A head appears, wearing a Second World War helmet with goggles...Barking.” This the audience registers as Rooster: confusingly he is wearing a helmet as if in war, a clear allusion to the previous association of some sort of cultural resistance, but is acting like a literal barking dog and madman. The idea of resistance to state oppression through the gentrification of the area is evident in the disruption Rooster is causing, but it does not seem to be his intention. Neither does it seem he cares about any cultural oppression, only for himself.

Immediately however, the audience sympathises and is attracted to Rooster as the archetypal fool and rebel. His charisma and reactionary stance to Kennet and Avon and the privileged upper class, going so far as to call them “sorry cunts on the New Estate” aligns Rooster with the audience as a likeable character due to his ridiculousness juxtaposed with satirical formality. Although the perhaps subconsciously built previous expectations of what Rooster could be were oxymoronic and still somehow completely subverted, there is still some sense that Rooster truly is this resistance conjured by the Waterloo symbolism and Romantic imagery of the setting contrasted with the rubbish. That even though the apparent cultural hegemony has been built, Rooster’s sane madness and irresponsibility somehow breaks through this in a bubble of winning resistance.

This binary opposition between the formal and informal, oppressive responsible normality and freeing individual irresponsibility, drawn by the presentation of Rooster in Act 1 therefore serves to the deconstruction of what is expected to be the solution to the gentrification and cultural imperialism which dominates the context of the play.

The presentation of Rooster as an amoral and yet honourably individually moral character comes second to this social function to the audience of him. By identifying Rooster as the rebellious fool, the audience is immediately consciously drawn to his charisma and function as a character rather than consciously to his function as a point of social contrast. Rooster’s outlandish lies as excuses for being unavailable “on account of the fact he’s in Barbados this week with Kate Moss,” having done “Unspeakable acts”, and insistence that it the party was “a gathering” or he “had a quiet one” further identifies Rooster with the fool. Furthermore it identifies his amoral attitude towards lying and lack of regard for social convention, while preserving his nature as a likeable character by so far not displaying any perceived evil acts or flaws, simply hilarious attitudes and excuses. This is furthered by the long stage descriptions of what Rooster has for his breakfast and hygiene. Although the audience recognises that Rooster is an easily dislikeable person to be around for extended periods, they retain their attraction to Rooster as a likeable character.

The sense of a code of honour or pride is seen during the conversation where Rooster turns his confrontation of whether he knows where Phaedra is, and his drug and alcohol selling to underage children into a criticism of Wesley for doing the same and hypocritically claiming it is “different” simply for doing it in a capitalistically accepted way by doing so in the form of a precariously legal business,  a pub. Butterworth builds on a presentation of Rooster as a father-figure—typically the head of a family in social norms and as the caring yet not pampering family figure—by this confrontation that at least he accepts what he does unlike Wesley. This however is oxymoronic, as it is evident that Rooster does not accept what he does, as seen by his lack of care for the truth in withholding his knowledge, or lack thereof, of Phaedra’s location and constant lying to avoid responsibility. Nonetheless, because the previous was hidden by jest, the audience does not fully register this inherent hypocrisy, and becomes convinced by Butterworth’s presentation of Rooster as a caring (in an unconventional way) figure by providing a place for the younger generation to not “sit in the bus stop, shivering their bollocks off”. This sense of parental protection or provision is further seen by the audience when Pea “kisses Johnny on the cheek” and thanks him “for letting us stop over.” This builds a sense that Rooster has a sense of honour through his defence of himself and of others, and that he is not noble in the typical Jungian archetypal way of the fool or the hero, but honourable in his amoral code of parental protection.

This concludes to a conflicting image of Rooster as the overwhelmed yet overwhelming resistance to oppression by the state through gentrification, and hegemony by foreign cultural influence; the already lost yet somehow naively winning force; and the hypocritically moral code of an amoral man as a parental figure to an entire generation. He is therefore both a social application for the deconstruction of social structure, and an internal force of contrast within the play.
# E2: Play emotional response
### “A play should make you laugh or should make you cry.” With reference to Jerusalem, discuss the methods Jez Butterworth uses to generate an emotional response in the audience.

Butterworth is able to generate an imitation of the despair the characters in Jerusalem experience in the audience through various methods of creating and showing humour. The audience vicariously experiences the characters’, shame, and despair at their escapism. Furthermore, by changing the way humour is made and showed, the audience experiences a broader range of emotions and both gains a greater understanding of the characters’ minds and the class distinctions in English society. 

Firstly, Butterworth uses the stage to simultaneously create humour and despair in the audience. Butterworth immediately juxtaposes the setting of the Prologue and the beginning of Act One visually and aurally. By interrupting Phaedra’s performance of the song Jerusalem with “Thumping music” and having her “flee”, the audience is immediately drawn to question where the thumping music is coming from; immediately afterwards the curtain rises to reveal “A clearing in a moonlit wood” and the source of “deafening bass” coming from “an old forty foot mobile home”. The sharp contrast of simple unaccompanied singing against the immense loudness which was visually fled to is certainly humorous, even more with “people dancing wildly, with abandon”. It is hard to reconcile the folk-lore imagery of the “moonlit wood” with the madness of the rave in the forest, especially so in the next arrangement of the stage. The idyllic setting degraded by deteriorating furniture and “Lots of junk” is a forceful composite of superficial cheap Americanised consumer culture—the “old American style fridge” and “Coca-Cola plastic chairs” and useless items littered on the floor—with British nationalism, signified by the old Wessex flag, Waterloo sign and previous singing of Jerusalem, and of natural and created states. The sensory juxtaposition in the stage directions allows for a release of emotion in laughter or humorous reaction to the mess which is the set, further satirised by the contrasting ideas of what England is. 

By producing this effect in the audience, Butterworth is able to bring to light the oppositions in broader society and British culture; the mess which is the characters’ environment is a representation of our own surroundings. Further oppositions allow Butterworth to directly satirise attempts at control. Parsons and Fawcett are “dressed the same”, a symbol of uniformity opposing the irregularity of the stage design, and “gingerly” navigate the landscape. The audience perceives the two Community Liaison Officers’ evident displeasure and ineffective bureaucracy as a humorous contrast to the familiarity Byron projects in this chaos. The irritability of Fawcett and Parsons very obvious in the way they behave: when Fawcett “touches up her lipstick” it plays into the idea of wanting to both look better than the other and behave better to show superiority and control—something which she ironically loses by doing this—and the mostly short and quick sentences which Butterworth writes them to say when speaking to Byron furthers this; when combined with Byron’s large speeches and familiar chaotic speaking manner, this becomes more evident. This opposition between the oppressive state having control yet the representatives lacking it, Fawcett and Parsons, and the opposite for the oppressed classes, Byron, is a comedic contrast which brings to attention the irony of the current social organisation through the humour of the characters’ situations. More so, it allows us to gain an understanding of the character’s minds in how they use humour or are used as humour. 

Although all the characters are certainly being used by the playwright, there is an important distinction between the characters which are written to be willingly funny, and those who are purposefully written to be perceived as humorous but not as trying to. This is clearly seen in the previous example and in the failed attempts of character’s humour, such as when Byron fails to make Dawn laugh. This applies further to the opposition of control, and also offers an alternative possibility of the humour’s function. This difference in the way the characters are written also applies to the environment created on the stage; when Rooster mentions the surroundings as a joke, such as the scene with the golden drum, the humour created has a much different emotion than when we see the mess he is living in and the humour associated with that. This serves as a parallel to how humour and purposeful showing of irony in modern society is selective, in that we only notice our irreconcilable and despairing condition of Being and society’s state through humour, selecting those areas which we find are not too heavy and lightening their load, acknowledging them mockingly to perhaps avoid having to change. 

This method of avoiding the true situation is further reflected in Byron’s denial of his inevitable removal and possible incarceration, the younger characters’ literal escape to “Rooster’s woods”—even more strikingly so Phaedra’s—and the outrageous stories Rooster tells to avoid responsibility. That the audience finds a humour-masked sadness in this is telling of the state of current social issues: although the younger groups are outwardly having a good time, they have “nowhere else to go”, Phaedra seems cheerful but is forced into hiding and has nowhere to run to afterwards, and Byron’s stories hide the sadness of his inability to take responsibility or be anything more than the Fool who is seen as enlightened by other Fools. By structuring the method of generating humour to be different in many situations, Butterworth is able to express the helplessness of the characters and their attempts at escapism as ultimately fruitless. 

This willingness and wish to disbelieve the current situation and escape from reality is also reflected in the audience’s wish for Byron to succeed and remain where he is as he so confidently, yet disbelievingly, proclaims throughout the play. This wish that one could perform a suspension of disbelief, which is ultimately as far as the audience can come to suspend disbelief, is revealing to the characters’ own hidden ideas. Although one can try to imagine Byron as being successful in his curse and an army of giants and ancestors descending to save and destroy, the trying to believe is as far as the audience is able to reach given Butterworth’s use of humour in the play, especially through Rooster. To believe this story is similar to a combination of Davey and Ginger playing along to Rooster’s story about the giant, and Dawn’s simple statement “You were kidnapped by traffic wardens.” It is a simple summary of what Byron has said, without any true belief or attempt at believing, simply going along to avoid facing the truth of the situation; the audience recognises the lie underneath and is only able to want it to be true in the same way that Byron tries to at the end. Because of this, one does not find the final story which Rooster tells to no one but the audience humorous, but saddening. In doing this, Butterworth is able to use humour for its opposite effect, and cause the audience to notice even further the folly and escapism it attempts to be. This is a reflection of Byron himself at the end of the play, unable to fully believe his own lies as he playfully did before, yet trying to for a final escape. 

To conclude, Butterworth is able to subvert the usual effect of humour by its previous use throughout the play to strengthen the emotional response of despair and hopelessness the end of the final Act 3 creates and the characters slowly admit to themselves. The various methods of creating humour and using it further aim to demonstrate the escapism frequent in society and contradictions one would rather not face; by the various uses of humour and methods to create it, Butterworth produces an immense range of emotion in the audience and uses this intentional emotion to further the plot and almost mimetically imitate the characters’ own emotions and fall.
