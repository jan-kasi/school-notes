# 02 Dedicatory Letter to the Sorbonne & Preface
3-9
- Descartes writes with purpose
- Faith is enough for the believer, but the non-believer demands a naturalistic explanation, which D will attempt to provide
- Proving that God exists and the real distinction between mind and body
- Descartes feels a personal responsibility to write the Meditations
- It is important to understand the order and connections in his argument, instead of picking at the individual sentences--i.e. the logic between, not within.
- Includes the criticism and responses, which form part of D's argument.
- Not very nice to atheists, basically says that atheists aren't very intelligent. "as for the atheists, who are generally posers..."
- Basically sucking up to the Sorbonne
- Clear agenda
- Questions falsehood: par: "would a benevolent God allow us to believe something which is false"

Either god is very important or irrelevant.  

Faith is based off rationality and reason – faith means faith in god not to say that faith is belief without reason.
Catholic church has always valued the human reason – Aquinas calls it ratio – it is valuable for Descartes.
He tries to fit his ideas to Catholicism?  

## Where does the pug come from?  

Scientific – male and female pug which leads to fertilisation and leads to zygote and so on. Modern causation: linear.   

Not how Descartes saw the world. This idea is from a Post-Cartesian world, it is only beginning to emerge.

Scholastic science – Aristotle (aka The Philosopher)  

Largely based on the work of Aristotle: 

- The behaviour of objects/substances was explained through their properties
- Bulbs sprout into flower because they contain the property of sprouting

A teleological view of the universe was favoured – to explain something you point to its end/goal. Things are explained by their end purpose.

To reach the final purpose you actualise/realise your properties.  

How would scholastic science explain a pug? 

- Identify its properties
- Causation is something that the object is heading to
- The pug has to head towards a final cause
- Behind the pug is the efficient cause – this has been preserved by science  

The telos has been rejected by modern science.  

There are also the material and formal causes – cause = comprised of.  

The influence of Descartes was an empiricist  

Aquinas theologies Aristotle

Aristotle's views were assimilated into Christianity  

Aquinas adds the idea that all of the four causes come from God 

Paradigm of theory of knowledge  

The 17th century that Descartes was born into was starting to reject these ideas. 

Modern science is founded on what you can measure and then explaining the relationships between those measurements.  
- They start to reject the final causes  
- Things were being explained and predicted as they never had been before  

The reformation – direct public challenge to Catholicism. You can challenge the pope. Martin Luther should have been killed but he wasn't.  

Skepticism emerges – again? Cartesian skepticism emerges.  

Ratio and synderesis  

God is transcendent but he has allowed you to know what he wants
