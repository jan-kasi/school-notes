# 41 Q: Causal Argument

a. Explain Descartes' causal argument.
b. Evaluate Descartes' causal argument.

## A


Intro:
Causal argument is trademark + contingency
Innate ideas link to rationalism.

Sections: 
1. Causal Adequacy Principle (a posteriori), how it applies to ideas.
- "there is at least as much reality in the efficient and total cause as in its effect" (Causal adequacy)
- this applies to ideas because they cannot come from nothing, as they are something (innate, adventitious, and factious all come from "something")
2. Trademark
- "something something I find within me the idea of the infinite..."
- idea of the infinite, but I am a finite being because I have imperfections. If I was infinite I wouldn't therefore I'm not the cause of my own existence nor of this idea.
- Idea of the infinite must come from something infinite, God. Therefore infinite idea is a trademark God placed within me.
3. Contingency
- "a lifespan can be divided into countless parts, each completely independent of the others", existence at one point doesn't entail existence at another point. There must be something preserving my existence.
- Preservation and creation are the same power
- As I cannot and have not created myself, I cannot preserve myself (refer to 2, I am not infinite), therefore I am reliant on something else to preserve me.
- Whatever caused me must have an idea of the infinite, i.e. it *is* the infinite or it is finite with infinite idea.
- If I am caused by a finite thing, with the idea of the infinite, it must be caused by something else with the idea of infinite.
- There cannot be an infinite regress, so there must be an infinite causer (with attributes of God, therefore God) (which caused its own existence Causal Adequacy).
- Ultimately I am caused and preserved by God.
4. God exists as the Infinite First Cause who cased/preserves my existence
- Attack possible with Catton, original in the first place started with an assumption based on theological belief (which Descartes' is purporting to prove, and not use as this is for the atheist).

## B
Order Innate ideas X; Causation X contingency in general X; Catton X 

Hume: criticism of a posteriori claims, criticism of causality, criticism of cosmological arguments (applicable?), criticism of idea of infinite/god, criticism of no needed cause. Targets both CAP, Trademark and Contingency

Locke criticism of innate ideas; targets trademark and therefore contingency argument needing God to be the final cause. 

Need to trust that infinite is there and that it can point to God as cause. Hume and Locke combined can target both ideas and logic.

Can use Objection that we cannot grasp the concept of the infinite with our limited intellect. Descartes counters that this confuses fully adequate conception and an understanding suited to the scale of the intellect. Perhaps return that is this truly infinite idea/we still do not fully understand it to be able to argue to God.

Maybe Gassendi criticism that all ideas are adventitious (and that we cannot perceive the infinite, therefore no actual idea of infinite).

(Causal) Adequacy:
even if causation disproved. Even if some things aren't causal then adequacy still has to be destoryed. Hume is not enough, you need to get rid of Adequacy (link to level of reality).
If we form the idea of infinite (i.e. hume) or it is adventitious then the finite has caused the infinite. this is counterexample.
Also, attack if it is a CDP.
Also, Descartes' never quantifies what is greater. Also assumption that something greater causes something lesser (or equal), lesser things causing greater things is not a thing. (Now we tend to go from small to big; Descartes' paradigm is great to lesser; now, however, we do think that we cannot create things where there was none (i.e. combination, but not causing something essentially greater even if emergent))
Emergent phenomena?
