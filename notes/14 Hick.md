# 14 Hick
## John Hick, eschatological verification
1. what is the verification principle
- a sentence is meaninful iff its truth or falisty can be verified empirically.
2. what is the falsification principle
- a sentence is meaningful iff it can be verified AND there is a way it can be empirically proven false.
3. If there is an afterlife, does the ability to stand in the good place mean that religious statements are testable?

Hick reads Ayer's updated work on strong and weak verification and notices that anything eschatlogical could be verified after you die.
Eschatological sentences are verifiable in principle, we cannot verify it now because we are not dead. After the transition from life,we are able to verify it.
Being in the good place verifies it, even if it is not empirical, the very fact you're there is verification.
It is possible to experience the good place
Don't demand of another realm what you can demand of this one, there is a possibility to experience eschatological states, they are verifiable.

## Hick: parable of The Celestial City
> "two men traveling along a road that one believes leads to a celestial city and the other believes leads to nowhere. Though they each have the dame experiences along the road, the first interprets the experiences as trials to prepare him for the Celestial City, while the other finds the experiences to have no larger meaning."

Both statements are meaningful because they can have their truths verified in principle, because the celestial city will either be reached, or never reached.

The issue is not an experimental one, they fo not think about the details of the road, only about its ultimate destination. "And yet when they do turn the last corner it will be apparent that one of them has been right all the time and the other wrong."
The issue is not experimental, but it has been a real issue. They do not mereley feel differently about the road; for one was feeling appropiaately and the other innapropiately to the real state of affairs.

The eschatological aspect of Christianity provide "an experientially verifiable claim, in virtue of which the belief-system as a whole is established as being factually true-or-false"
Hick, *Faith and Knowledge*

Is the fact that we cannot experience being annihilated and no longer exist if there is *no* good place fatal?
we can't experience non-existence. But maybe not being able to experience anything is proof itself, not for you or anyone but for itself. The Real.


Cfiticism:

- haven't we just invented the posibility of this verification?
  - assumptions of how it would work eschatologically?
- does this link to weak/strong verification which Ayer rejected in his career? It does not link to Direct/Indirect verification.
  - there aren't observations which lead it to be probable that there is an afterlife.
  - fails the weak test, can not be verified strongly in the current place
  - it works with the probable and non-probable update.
  - there is an argument that Hick does not prove the verification of eschatology, but the failure of verification
