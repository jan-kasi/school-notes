# ch 23-25 questions
## 23
### How does Voltaire present England?
Voltaire presents England as wasting too much money on unnecessary wars and as carrying out injustices to appease the public.
England is presented as wanting to be superficially superior instead of caring about justice. Petty attempts to conquer more territory instead of fixing their problems at home.
Martin says it is "a different type of madness" to France, but just as bad.
The madness in this case is about the state and authority, wheras in France it is social madness.
Comparison to France: instead of being opulent and excessive it is dark, "gloomy", and restrained but violent.


## Chapter 24
### How does Voltaire create sympathy for Paquette?
Paquette hasn't been seen since the beginning of the novel.
All of things which the reader would assume were good to happen are subverted to be negative.
We hear she has been cured of syphilus but the consequences are worse.
There is much repetition to demonstrate how many times this has happened to her. There is no escape from mistreatment.
Everything is shown as pointless and having no purpose or positive consequence.
We see the effects of social hypocricy and satire which Voltaire has been building. Paquette is symbolic of the effects of social exploitation.
First person perspective.
### How is religion satirised in this chapter?
People in religious institutions shown as not actually believing in the religion or being forced.
Association of religion with promiscuity, prostitution, corruption, and exploitation. The hypocricy of organised religion.
Using religious institutions for personal gains, e.g. the Theatine monk's parents.
Theatine monk says he wants to attack the monastery and convert to Islam. Then suggests all the other monks are in similar situations. Suggests monks are not motivated by faith or accept religion anf live by its values
New perspective: earlier depictions of monks focus on their exploits and abusiveness, here we see them as also victims.
## Chapter 25
### “Wherever you look, you find only empty systems, and not a single thing of use.” (p.77) How is this to shown to be the case in the novel so far?
All the value and belief systems are shown as being false and meaningless, or useless and harmful.
### What is the significance of Pococuranté’s depiction in the novel?
- Think about what it suggests about Voltaire’s attitude towards criticism (especially in the context of the Enlightenment) and towards optimism?

Criticism also doesn't create happiness. Even though he seems to have no worries he is not happy because he is shown as unhappy and miseable.
Even though he has everything he could want, he still wants more.
What one person expects will make others happy (Candide) doesn't actually make the people who has them happy (Pococurante).
Lack of fulfillment, feels bored and empty.
Here is the supposed happiest man in Europe, and even he is not happy.
Foreshadowing Candide's possible reunion with Cunegonde, the pursuit is more important than the relationship.
