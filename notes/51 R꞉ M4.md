# 51 R꞉ M4


Caton
> Gilson's study of the sources of the Meditations led him to conclude that the work, particularly the Fourth Meditation, was a "tissue of borrowings" from theologians ancient and contemporary; and he attributed this eclecticism to Descartes's anxiety to ensure acceptance of his physics in a world dominated by theology.

Perhaps this is not a bad thing.

Descartes' attempt to use philosophy and theology?
