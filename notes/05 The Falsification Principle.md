# 05 The Falsification Principle

What would convince you that:
1. I was not a real person
2. The world was not round
3. No one has ever walked on the moon


The verification principle:
- A statement is meaningful iff it can be verified
The falsification principle:
- A statement is meaningful iff it can be falsified

Meaningfullness is if something can be proven to be true tautologically or empirically

i.e. A statement is meaningful iff it is possible to be proven *false* and there is something which provides evidence for it being true.
- You need a statement which can be proven false and proven true

Falsification adds an extra hurdle to the verification principle

A falsifiable statement is one which can be proven true or false

## Karl Popper
The father of falsification
An example of falsification:
- Popper contrasted Einstein's theory of gravity with astrology
  - Astrology: Not able to be tested against the universe, e.g. "You shall meet a tall dark stranger"; vagueness of language, non-cognitive, and timeframe.
  > "It is a typical soothsayer's trick to predict hings so vaguely that the predictions can hardly fail: that they become irrefutable
  - Gravity: Testable. It is supported by empirical evidence, and can therefore be (and has been) tested against the universe

Popper has an issue that it is always possible for something; what Popper wants is *cartainty* of if a statement is meangingful and true/false.
Popper wants fixed parameters for things to be testable
