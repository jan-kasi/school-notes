# 34 M6 Challenges: Berkeley, Hume, Kant
## Berkeley

## Hume
> To have recourse to the veracity of the Supreme Being, in order to prove the veracity of our senses, is surely making a very unexpected circuit. If his veracity were at all concerned in this matter, our senses would be entirely infallible; because it is not possible that he can ever deceive.

**What does this have to do with M6?**
Descartes claims that "notwithstanding the immense goodness of God, the nature of man as a combination of mind and body is such that it is bound to mislead him from time to time."

1. Circle:
  A(God proven by CDP) --> B(CDP proven by God)
  A --> B --> A
2. God's perfection must equal perfect senses (counters in 33 Ragland and M4)

**To what extent do you agree?**


## Kant

Phenomenal: the world as we perceive it.
Noumenal: the world as it really is.

**What does this have to do with M6?**
Descartes' is trying to use the phenomenal to access the noumenal (and justifies this using the noumenal to support the phenomenal being correct?) / Descartes thinks he can access the noumenal as extension and geometric properties in Formal Reality.

**To what extent do you agree?**
