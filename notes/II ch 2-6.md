# II ch 2-6

### ch 6
Linton wants Edgar to accompany him, and treats this going away as a 'moving house' thing rather than the imprisonment it'll be 
- LINK TO GOTHIC :D 
Nelly takes him to the Heights, and tries to portray it in a good light. 
- Heathcliff puts on a show of happiness, but Linton is more frightened than anything and understands little of what Heathcliff and Joseph say 
- The way Heathcliff talks is quite dated; represents their societal isolation. 
- This is where Heathcliff vocalises his 'big plan' (page 208): 
> “my son is prospective owner of your place, and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his successor. Besides, he’s mine, and I want the triumph of seeing my descendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children to till their fathers’ lands for wages. That is the sole consideration which can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate him for the memories he revives! But that consideration is sufficient: he’s as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master tends his own. I have a room upstairs, furnished for him in handsome style; I’ve engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from twenty miles’ distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn. I’ve ordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I’ve arranged everything with a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his associates. I do regret, however, that he so little deserves the trouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a worthy object of pride; and I’m bitterly disappointed with the whey-faced, whining wretch!” (https://www.gutenberg.org/files/768/768-h/768-h.htm) 

- Linton not liking the milk porridge highlights his isolation both up north and in the Heights. 

- Linton immediately hates it; all Nelly does despite his protests is leave. 

## Class discussion
### Structure
Volume I and II are divided by Catherine's death. What is the effect of this?
- The previous characters are archetypes for the incoming people. 
- Catherine is the binding character between the incoming people. 
- Catherine is the first person Lockwood sees as a ghost and she is the person that starts off the story 
- It fragments the story into a story about multiple people and their individual relationships instead of many people in a collective relationship. 
- The outsider who is now coming in - Isabella's son
- It is almost like Catherine has returned through Cathy, they share the same name, tie everyone together in a similar way, act similarly 
- It continues the timeline which means that there is now an era of Catherine. 
- It amplifies the theme of doubles

What does each volume focus on?
Volume 1:
- Relationship between the original characters
Volume 2:	
 -The effects that these relationships had 
Volume 1 plants the seeds for Heathcliff's revenge whereas volume two shows him carrying out this revenge 

What changes between volumes one and two?
- Catherine dies and the birth of her daughter 
- Isabella dies and the birth of her daughter 
- Heathcliff kills Hindley and gains Hareton
- Heathcliff new proprietor of Wuthering Heights

nature: doomed to recreate their parent's actions
nurture: doomed to their actions by growing up in a highly dysfunctional environment

Heathcliff enters as unwanted outsider to WH, Linton enters as wanted outsider to TG

Vol I characters as archetypes for Vol II - Catherine's omnipresence and 'haunting' of the narrative
- C is the crucial character linking the two generations - generation divide
Fragmentation of relationships and characters

H+C as a 'unifying' narrative focal point in Vol I --> focus split between characters in Vol II - reversal of fortunes (tragedy)

Vol I as a template for Vol II --> nature or nurture in replicating behaviour of former generations

### Doubles
Pairs:
- Catherine and Heathcliff
- Heathcliff vs Hindley (siblings)
- Heathcliff vs Edgar (rival lovers)
- Thrushcross Grove vs Wuthering Heights
- Houses vs Moors
- Human vs Nature
- Linton vs Hareton
- Young Catherine and Young Heathcliff
- Cathy and Heathcliff
- Cathy and Edgar
- Past and Present narration
- Narrative voices
- Lockwood as outsider
- Insiders and Outsiders

- reader vs writer

Lintons = refined, proper, socially respected, generally nicer/"good" people
Earnshaws/Heathcliff = unrefined, socially complex, generally meaner/"bad" people

C and H innocent attachment corrupted by society and TG (brings the expectations)

Gothic doubles
- Duality within a character between good and evil
- Catherine's fluctuations in behaviour
- Young and Old
Doppelganger
- Psychological state
- Supernatural
- Double or mirror image of a person, with an uncanny side
- Repressed or dark side
- Freud, the uncanny
- Quest for individual identity -> link to society

### Characterisation
Young Cathy:
- Physical appearance similar to Catherine, deceptive exterior
- Heathcliff's hatred due to resemblance to Catherine
- Defiance of Nelly
Hareton:
- Corrupted and status declined
- Heathcliff's revenge/victory and exploitation
- Made to be a servant like Heathcliff was

Characters share names:
- Cyclical nature of the two houses, perhaps like a commentary on the perpetual effect of society to do this
  - Inevitable
  - Tragic links
- Past houses still remain
- Breaking of a cycle more noticeable
- Hubris, perhaps?
- Does Heathcliff manage to break the cycle or perpetuates it
- Death of son = chance to end the cycle 
Heathcliff as a possessive character
- Holds Hareton and Linton captive
- Owns WH and TG to defy social constraints
  - Chooses to destroy the houses and their associated families

Heathcliff's motivations for raising Linton
- To spite Edgar
- Possessiveness
- Defy Edgar's (perceived?) saviour complex
- Heir, act of defiance/reclamation
- Linton's status as an outsider reflects HC's role (that he also took with Catherine)

Heathcliff perhaps blames Cathy as killing Catherine and stealing her (due to uncanny resemblance)

Nelly
- Abandons Linton even after witnessing abuse and slander
- Increases sympathy for Linton
- Negative view of Nelly
  - Nelly is telling the story, if Nelly looks bad then, then how bad was it actually?
- Servant/Master relationship / Class criticism

### Themes
Conflicts between nature and civilisation
- Children
  - Inability to act freely, even though they want to/act so
  - Family
  - Even "instinctive" parental love is corrupted by the environment
- Edgar/TG = civilisation
- HC/WH = primal nature??? or perhaps corrupted civilisation, this I find more likely
- Death in childbirth = natural process. but forced by society/civilisation
- Catherine's grave between the two houses = symbolic of Catherine's conflict between civilisation and nature (and savagery?)
- Hareton = servant and not in "civilisation", but actually her cousin in nature

- Pregnancy
  - Did Edgar even know before so, Nelly even?
  - We don't know until it happens, perhaps a satire of Victorian society's taboo against pregnant women who have to stay out of sight and become hysterical

Contemporary anxieties about class in Victorian age
- Blurring of class hierarchy and distinction
- Hubris and reversals of fortune
- Immediate loathing of HC on arrival at WH
- Catherine tries to level the divide but can't
- Usurping of the upper class' power
- Hatred due to jealousy (Nelly and Joseph) or class prejudice (Hindley)
- Reasons for the lower classes wanting to change the system

Symbolism:
- "desert" = escapism, desire, desolate and alone, beyond/transcending WH and TG (nature transcending society?)
- Dogs get into a fight: TG and WH always collide and in conflict, resulting in injury
  - dogs return to the house with swollen head and bleeding ear (foreshadowing Catherine's return to the house and her distress). Ehhh, not a great point
  - Catherine's puppy= youth, kindness, Hareton's caring nature even though he has been through a lot
    - Catherine's rejection of it = stubbornness, privilege, ungratefulness, class prejudice
- "scrawny body", vulnerability, reflecting his upbringing by the Lintons (sheltered, spoiled), physical and mental weakness, emphasises the differences between Heathcliff and his son
  - Similarity to Isabella/reminder he is her daughter, Heathcliff hates Isabella
  - Heathcliff doesn't see himself in him
