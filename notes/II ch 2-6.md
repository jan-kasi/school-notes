# II ch 2-6

### ch 6
Linton wants Edgar to accompany him, and treats this going away as a 'moving house' thing rather than the imprisonment it'll be 
- LINK TO GOTHIC :D 
Nelly takes him to the Heights, and tries to portray it in a good light. 
- Heathcliff puts on a show of happiness, but Linton is more frightened than anything and understands little of what Heathcliff and Joseph say 
- The way Heathcliff talks is quite dated; represents their societal isolation. 
- This is where Heathcliff vocalises his 'big plan' (page 208): 
> “my son is prospective owner of your place, and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his successor. Besides, he’s mine, and I want the triumph of seeing my descendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children to till their fathers’ lands for wages. That is the sole consideration which can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate him for the memories he revives! But that consideration is sufficient: he’s as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master tends his own. I have a room upstairs, furnished for him in handsome style; I’ve engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from twenty miles’ distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn. I’ve ordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I’ve arranged everything with a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his associates. I do regret, however, that he so little deserves the trouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a worthy object of pride; and I’m bitterly disappointed with the whey-faced, whining wretch!” (https://www.gutenberg.org/files/768/768-h/768-h.htm) 

- Linton not liking the milk porridge highlights his isolation both up north and in the Heights. 

- Linton immediately hates it; all Nelly does despite his protests is leave. 

## Structure
Volume I and II are divided by catherine's death. What is the effect of this?
- The previous characters are archetypes for the incoming people. 
- Catherine is the binding character between the incoming people. 
- Catherine is the first person lockwood sees as a ghost and she is the person that starts off the story 
- It fragments the story into a story about multiple people and their individual relationships instead of many people in a collective relationship. 
- The outsider who is now coming in - isabella's son
- It is almost like Catherine has returned through Cathy, they share the same name, tie everyone together in a similar way, act similarly 
- It continues the timeline which means that there is now an era of Catherine. 
- It amplifies the theme of doubles

What does each volume focus on?
Volume 1:
- Relationship between the original characters
Volume 2:	
 -The effects that these relationships had 
Volume 1 plants the seeds for Heathcliff's revenge whereas volume two shows him carrying out this revenge 

What changes between volumes one and two?
- Catherine dies and the birth of her daughter 
- Isabella dies and the birth of her daughter 
- Heathcliff kills Hindley and gains Hareton
- Heathcliff new proprietor of Wuthering Heights

nature: doomed to recreate their parent's actions
nurture: doomed to their actions by growing up in a highly dysfunctional environment

Heathcliff enters as unwanted outsider to WH, Linton enters as wanted outsider to TG

Vol I characters as archetypes for Vol II - Catherine's omnipresence and 'haunting' of the narrative
- C is the crucial character linking the two generations - generation divide
Fragmentation of relationships and characters

H+C as a 'unifying' narrative focal point in Vol I --> focus split between characters in Vol II - reversal of fortunes (tragedy)

Vol I as a template for Vol II --> nature or nurture in replicating behaviour of former generations
