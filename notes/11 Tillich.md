# 11 Tillich
Symbols:
- point beyond themselves
- participate in what they point to
- one must engage with a symbol to access the thing they point to.
- symbols require a context, and change with context

- a human needs to be involved

For tillich, you need human endeavour to accept or reject the symbol. There is not an external reality you access, but an active and personal engagement with the symbol in the right context to access what they represent.

Three things are required
- the symbol and what it points to
- the context of the symbol
- the human

Symbols change, but this is just because the change of cultural interaction with the divine.


Symbolic language doesn't go through the divine to you, it is the attempt to discuss the divine through you to the divine. It expresseding the ideology and there is no true objective connection to the divine but to the symbol, just a meaningful discussion. You interact with the divine through the symbol.
It is not talking about God, it is expressing the truths held of the religious and participating in the symbol to access the indescribable.
You can know God and access the deeper truth by participating in the symbol, you do not rach the divine, but the symbol you interact with does.

Difference with analogous language. Analogous language means that we get to God by comparison.

What is the difference between someone talking about God not there, and someone else talking about God? What is the knowledge difference, if any?
- faith as knowledge, Tillich is not trying to prove God exists
