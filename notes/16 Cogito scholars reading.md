# 16 Cogito scholars reading
Criticism 1 from the Objections:
- Gassendi: "you might have inferred that from any other activity, since our natural light informs us that whatever acts also exists."
- D reply: Yet while we can doubt the action is taking place, we cannot doubt the experience of it or thinking of it is taking place.

Criticism 2 from Russel:
- The cogito says more than what is necessary, not "I think/I see this", but "Something thinks/something sees"
- That which thinks might be momentary and not the same as the something which has some different experience the next moment
- D reply: Yet, does D say that this is persistent? I don't think he does, the cogito being dependent on the present and that one would cease to exist in the strict sense if not thinking. Further, the cogito has to be personal and about this "I", it cannot be experienced or thought about something else other than that experiencing it.
- D objection: However, why is this thought necessarily one continuous thought (or does it not matter?)? Further, is it being about the "I" a linguistic confusion/flaw?

Criticism 3 from Hume:
- Cannot identify *myself* as something, "I never can catch *myself* at any time without a perception, and never can observe anything but the perception".
- Hume cannot observe the self as an actual thing, only as a bundle of perceptions
- While D claims to be intimately conscious of some self and feel its existence, Hume can never find this thing called self or have consciousness of himself other than but the perceptions

Criticism 4 from Lichtenberg:
- "It thinks" just as we say "It thunders", cogito is too much if it is "I think"
- "I think" is not something one does or is, but something one observes occurring?
- Some links to Russel?

Criticism 5 from the First Wittgenstein:
> There is no such thing as the subject which thinks or entertains ideas. ... The subject does not belong to the world: rather, it is a limit of the world. Where in the world is there a metaphysical subject to be found? You will say that this is exactly like the case of the eye and the visual field. But really you do *not* see the eye. And nothing *in the visual field* allows you to infer that it is seen by an eye.

- The eye cannot be inside its own visual field, it cannot see itself
- The subject is similarly so

Criticism 6 from the Objections:
Mersenne:
- "Up to this point you know that you are a being that thinks; but you do not know what this thinking thing is."
- This thinking thing could be a body which by "motion" produces what we call thought (functionalism link?).
- "For how will you prove that a body cannot think, or that its bodily motions are not thought itself?" (functionalism link! And problem of other minds? I think D addresses this later in the meditations)
- "'I am a thinking thing,' you say; but who knows but you are a corporeal motion, or a body in motion?"

## Positions on Cogito
### Russel
- Empiricist
- Self is changing
- Self = temporary
- The cogito goes too far, it does not establish an "I" which thinks and exists, but only that "something/it" does.
- From one moment to the next the self might be different
- Lockean memory
- Self experiencing could be different the next time, not necessarily the same/permanent "I"
- Receipt, not action: "A brown colour is being seen", "Something is being thought/existence is being experienced".
  - Receipt of existence, not action of the "I"
- Wants a necessity (of logical jump)

Counter by Cottingham's interpretation
- Either way, the I is involved with something
- Receipt is exactly what D means with the intellect
- cogito is only about the present I
- Not a logical thing, a self-verifying thought
- Changing I does not matter
- 

### Hume
- Existence = instances of perception
  - Regardless if self is collection itself or parts of collection, can be doubted.
- You can doubt your perceptions, existence becomes doubtable
- Every time you think about your existence it is prompted by sense perception
- What *you* are, what identity is, is simply a collection of perceptions (therefore is all doubtable)
- Denies the possibility of atempoalism

Begs question of empiricism v rationalism

### Wittgenstein
- All you have in existence is the experiences.
- Anti-realist: no accessible/existing external reality which is mind independent
- There is no subject self behind experience.
- No experiences of this self.
- No centrality behind it all.
- Language and games are identity and we have created our own.
- There is no absolute truth but there is truth in the individual 
- You cannot know anything except that which is decided among others. Even one claims it is not true, Wittgenstein would respond he is making a claim of truth as he accepts it within his own game, it might be false for you but it is true for him and in his game it is true for everyone.

But this only means the cogito is personal. There *is* **something**, but trying to defy it objectively goes wrong. This truth is limited to the personal. The I exists but it is unknowable.
