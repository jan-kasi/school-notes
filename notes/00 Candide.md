# 01 Intro

- Has aspects of the picaresque novel
- but a bildensrauman

- Banned immediately after it was published due to its blasphemy and political outspokenness

## Picaresque novel
Thrall and Hibbard
- normally in first person, presented as a pseudo-autobiographical novel
- not much of a cohesive unifying plot
- not much character development, character doesn't change
- Satire
- Tends to be immoral/outside of the law, but we are meant to side with them (like a mischiveous anti-hero)

1554: The life of Dariso De Tormes (?)
1594: ...?
1604: El Buson
1605: Don Quixote
1722: Moll Flanders

## piquaresque elements:
- short chapters
- cliffhangers



## context:
- 1755 Lisbon Earthquake
- Almost completely destroyed Lisbon
- Occured on Catholic holiday of All-Saints' Day, so some viewed it ass a religiously significant event
  - inquisitors do so in Candide
- problem of evil




# ch 05-6
## shipwreck
- death of jacques
- uselessness of a priori proofs
- unjustness

- shipwrecked

- uselessnes of "reasonable" philosophy
- human instinct and emotion > reason
- not universal if someone needs to police them and it is possible to break them

## catholicism
- the fall

- "all for the best"
- protestant - predestination


## the inquisition
- spanish and portuguese inquisition
- targeted jewish and muslim converts to christianity as they questioned their cincerity of thier loyalty of the Catholic Church
- institutions tasked with combating heresy

- "the infallible secret"
- ignorance, arrogance, and hubris
- "fine"

Auto-da-fé
- "act of faith"
- ritual of public penance caried out by condemned heretics
- huge ritual
- many prisoners did not know their sentences or what they were accused of until they were read out

- tenuous and weak evidence
- all up to interpretation
  - for speaking
  - for listening
  - for not liking bacon
# ch 07-11

## Context- treatment of Jews in Portugal
- 1492: spain exiled jewish population as part of Spanish Inquisition
- many fled to portugal, where their rights were given and taken away by a succession of monarchs. They had no stability nor guarantee of thier rights or freedom.

### Anti-semitism
- banned from many professions and positions of power.
- therefore many worked in trading or in money-lending.
- this led to the anti-Semitic idea of Jews being greedy, mercantile, and unseemly.
- also suspected of being a corruptive and satanic force, poisoning wells and communion wine, killing Christian babies to use their blood in black magic rituals, and seducing and tarnishing the honour of Christian women.

- during the englightenment, many countires began to enact religious *tolerance* laws.
- intellectuals begun to consider anti-Semitic laws as an example of the church having too much power and influence over the state.


## 8
- third person -> first person
- "artless simplicity"
- graphic
- detatched tone
- similar to Pangloss' description
- lack of personal subject

- Bulgar captain -> hypocricy
  - lambasts soldier for raping Cunégonde, but does the same
  - demands respect of soldier but not very respectful
  - "not much wit", "not been educated by Doctor Pangloss" (19)   } what use is this education?

- "a person of honour may be raped once, but her virtue emerges all the stronger for it"  (19)
  - something bad having good consequences does not make the bad neccessary or justified or good
  - something bad has good effects; leibnizian necessity
  - suffering > slight increase in vague traits

p20
- hypocricy of religion
- abuse of power
- auto-da-fé is not being used by the Grand Inquisitor for a greater spiritual purpose, but for personal gain
- lack of religious morality (link to inquisition agent, francisian & jesuit [syphilus])
- instead of focusing on their values and substance, they argue about particulars and ridiculous theological details
  - useless philsophy: in this case theology
- Candide and Cunégonde describe things as horrific and bad, and express surprise at how these are allowed to happen in this best of possible worlds. Yet they still try to justify why this it is actually wrong
  - "I praised God for bringing you back to me"
- traditional Christian ideas of forgiveness and nonretaliation not followed, e.g. Candide's killing of the 2 people
  - necessary choice of two evils
  - how choices are not always black and white
- "If Pangloss had not been hanged..."
  - irony
  - inconcistency and hypocricy of Candide's philosophy

- different in treatment is due to perception, not behaviour. e.g. Inquisitor burried in a beautiful dome and Jew in a heap



## Question:
Discuss in reference to *Candide, or Optimism*: "A satirical novel can never suceed in both satire and realism."

By nature of the genre, a satire can not suceed in both satire and realism. To satirise is to corrupt by a force of mockery and gross exagerration to the extreme to display the subject of satitire as equally or analogically ridiculous. In *Candide*, Voltaire satires the leibnizian philosophy of Optimism held by Candide and taught by Pangloss; the immense suffering and ridiculousness of the justifications made by Candide, Cunégonde, and Pangloss for the surprise at how their a posteriori experience does not fit with a best of possible worlds is such an example. In this, Voltaire is succesful in satire. Although one can easily make the case for the realism of the novel's events, being rooted in historical knowledge of what occured, it is not a succesful realism of what it satires.



# ch 11-13
![class](../maps/R&NE.svg)

## The Moors:
- North African Muslim civilisation
- Simultaneously exoticised and eroticised, and feared as barbaric and cruel (as seen in Candide)

## *Orientalism*
- critical term coined by Edward Said
  - the patronising and exoticising of non-european cultures by the european/west.
  - implicitly othering the non-european
  - fetishising the other

Orientalism and the Erotic
- the harem-houses of women kept by the rich and powerful
- art of this was popular
- image of white woman being sexually exploited by the "dark and dangerous Moors" was one which combined the eroticism and sensuality with the fear that the exotic provoked
- Voltaire draws on the common tropes of the Moors and North Africans as both brutal and sexual

- superiority of the european "even our simple chambermaids, possesed more charms than are to be found in the whole of Africa"

- Aristotelian idea of hotness misused to the continent of Africa which was physically hotter to explain/justify european belief that africans were more violent and impulsive

- "I was witness...hot blood" - irony of European superiority
  - the europeans are also incredibly viscious, e.g. the Bulgars and the wars in the novel
- p 27: "At length..."
  - brutality of war
  - reminiscent of Bulgars and 100 years war
  - "five daily prayers" - hypocricy, reminiscent of the auto-da-fé s, pedantic rules and regulations of religion without being concerned about the moral reality of their actions. parralell to the inquisitor and cunegonde.

  - chapter 12 title "*The misfortunes of the old woman, continued*"

  - captivity
  - cannibalism
  - plague
  
  - evils either caused by God (natural evils) or those who believe in God (moral evils)/States (divine right link?)

  - she is the DAUGHTER of the pope, he should be celibate...

  - everyone thinks they have suffered the most, the difference is that some pretend that even though they've suffered so much that this is the best possibility, or that they still don't want to die (majority), or the few which want to die

  - life is a burden, "carrying a fardel"
  - optimism is an exaggeration of a natural part of survival, it is not a serious way to think about things
  - optimism about life is just because it is "better than death", but life itself is not good


# ch 14-15
## the jesuits
- evangelism and proselytisation
- education
- ignatious founded the order
- vows of poverty, chastity, celibacy and obediency. with a special one of obedience to the pope

- went to Paraguay in 1558. Pope gave the Jesuits power to abolish the laws making the natives slaves to spanish conquistadores
- Voltaire praised the jesuits in spite of their satire in *Candide*

- "Empire within an Empire"- the Spanish had the territory but the Jesuits had the political control, not the Spanish Forces

## stuff in Candide
- Jesuits at war
  - they are meant to be a religious order, not a state or miliitary power
  - militaristic nature of the jesuits, Ignatious modelled the Jesuit order after an army
- "Los Padres* own everything, and the people own the rest"
  - satire of inequality of wealth and power
  - "justice and reason" -- irony
- Jesuits act in Europe as they should, but in South America they act as thier own kingdoms and not as they should
- behave as supporters of the King in Europe but against the King in Paraguay
- Jesuits living as the royals in europe do
- corruption of power
- inequality "gold vessels" vs. "wooden bowls...open fields"
- "master" Candide: slavery reference
- "negro slaves": the Jesuits did not explicitly enslave the paraguayans but were more than happy to import slaves from Africa

15
- no surprises, we have been told Candide is going to kill Cunegonde's brother from the chapter title
- suffers the same fate as Cunegonde, but is left for dead and Jesuits nurse him to health, "even prettier than before"
- he is inniciated to Order and quickly promoted
- head of Jesuits refered to as a "General", he is "recuiting" to send men to the New World. --> very militaristic
- "Reverend Father Croust"-- head of Jesuit college in Colmar, anti-philosophe, anti-Enlightnement.
- "I am now colonel and priest" --> should be oxymoronic/incompatible
- satirising works of Rousseau: "all men are equal"
  - Pangloss' own view
  - ironic as Candide is clearly not equal, he is not good enough to marry Cunegonde
  - ironic, they retain priveledge of wealth and status
- even after doing so much for Cunegonde and after Cunegonde has been through so much, Candide is still not allowed to marry her.
# ch 16
## savages

## The Noble Savage
- Romantic thinkers often greatly interested in non0WEstern cultures
- Many argued against colonialism as it repressed political freedom, was violently enforced, and did not agree with the cultural imperialism of the West
- Rousseau developed idea of the "Noble Savage

## ch 16
- can be seen as satirising the idea of the noble savage
- can be seen as also satirising the idea which colonial powers had of viewing these cultures as more savage (they only try to kill 2 people who killed and intruded on their territory, compared to the massive violence of the european wars; they treat candide much better than the europeans do after they forgive him)


- "what would...Pangloss say if he could see now how man lives in a state of nature"


|Rousseau|Hobbes|
|--------|------|


- Cacambo suggests cannibalism is not inherently wrong
  - it is less wasteful
  - it may be necessary
- Voltaire also argues for this separately
# ch 17-18 Depiction of Eldorado

## Write a paragraph explaining how Eldorado is depicted in Chapters 17–18 (400–500 words)

Eldorado is presented as a Utopia of riches and civility, detached from society and foreign influences. Voltaire satirises the idea that the world is the same everywhere as Cacambo presents it, “‘You see, this hemisphere is no better than the other one…let us go back to Europe’” by the characters finding themselves in this “perfect” land. Voltaire depicts Eldorado as a “big improvement”, yet still the characters are determined to not stay; even though Cacambo is proven wrong—there are better and worse places in the world—both characters wish to return to what they know and are familiar with. This satire of human greed is explained by the King when he tells them it is “a foolish scheme…when you are reasonably happy somewhere, you should stay put.” Furthermore their logic of living as kings once they leave is satirised, as the common children live better than many of the royalty in Europe. The satire is that there is a wish to be better than others, not to “be happy”. Therefore the Optimism the novel is a satire of is shown as inconsistent: even the characters who most dogmatically hold it want to be better than others and are not content with being equal.

That Candide and Cacambo leave the lands with their “pebbles” which are gold and gems could be seen as a comment on the nature of colonialism. Voltaire shows colonialism as destroying and imposing a different value system to a land, and as unreasonable to the indigenous communities. This is especially seen as Eldorado being a hidden land which the Incan people retreated to after colonial invasion, the citizens of Eldorado are presented as extremely kind and civil, and even willingly giving Cacambo and Candide their precious gems. This could be seen as a criticism of the nature of colonialism as unnecessary forceful taking, which destroys the beneficial cultural exchange and collaboration otherwise possible and means that the real treasures are not able to be gained or shared by pushing them away. Voltaire then criticises colonialism as a self defeating force with no benefits, the cultural exchange is stopped in favour of a lesser form of material taking than would’ve been possible without the colonial imposition by driving cultures away.

# ch 19–21 questions

## Chapter 19 
“My friend, you see how perishable are the riches of this world; nothing is certain but virtue” (p. 51) To what extent is this shown to be true in the novel? 

- Transience and impermanence of worldly, material goods, e.g. Cunegonde and the old woman’s jewellery stolen  
- Dutch pirate’s theft of Candide’s riches  
- Candide’s focus on Cunegonde over material goods (e.g. sacrifice of great riches in Eldorado) 
- Candide’s virtue/values in tact despite poverty 
- Love as a moral or material trait? 

Read the slave’s account of his life on p. 51-2. How does Voltaire present slavery and which institutions does he satirise in doing so? 

- Humanisation of the slave through his eloquent, first person narrative in order to demonstrate the intelligence and ability of the slave and rebut beliefs in racial inferiority 
- Suggests all people are created equal (a key Enlightenment value, e.g. liberte, egalite, fraternite) 
- Challenges Christian justifications for slavery by showing the moral character of the slave, suggesting they do not need ‘saving’ 
- Self-destruction, contradictions, hypocrisy 
- Fetish = an object to be worshipped 

How does Candide’s moral outlook change in this chapter? 

- Moves away from Pangloss’s optimism after seeing more of the world and hearing the slave’s narrative 
- The belief in optimism is only possible in Eldorado (a mythical, non-existent world) suggesting its lack of application in the real world 
- Loss of all worldly treasures through the pirate 
- Loss of innocence 

## Chapter 20 

Martin describes himself as a “Manichean”. What does he mean by this and to what extent is his viewpoint supported by the action of the novel so far? 

- Manichean = good and evil are equal and opposing forces 
- Mirrored by the structure of the novel, where good and evil come alternately and replace each other throughout 
- Evil comes to destroy good fortune, e.g. wealth/power 
- No ‘order’ or reason to good or bad events 

How are Candide and Martin’s views different? Which, if either, does Voltaire suggest we should agree with? 

- Candide still focused on Pangloss’s optimistic philosophy, though beginning to move away from it	 
- Lack of belief in reason, moral order, or justification for evil in Martin’s views 
- The universe is neither governed by good or bad 
- Structure of the novel suggests the loss of hope in characters and the reader – every time a good occurrence is seen, it is thwarted or undermined. Reader begins to be more pessimistic/sceptical of a clear moral or narrative resolution. 

What could Cunegonde be being used to represent at the end of the chapter? 

- Shows that Candide’s conversations with Martin have not eroded his sense of optimism, as he maintains his hope in finding her 
- Cunegonde as a concept/idea representing his belief in optimism 
- Cunegonde represents how the belief system one holds is largely dependant on circumstance

## Chapter 21 

How does Voltaire present his home country of France? 

- Presents opposing views of Candide and Martin 
- Candide suggests the cultural significance of France, reflecting views of the optimism of Europe 
- Martin gives an outsider’s view, emphasising the injustice and shallowness of France and its imperfections 
- What could be suggested by Martin's lack of interest or surprise in the accounts of Candide’s adventures? 
- Desensitised as he has seen so many “extraordinary” things 
- Believes that the world is strange and peculiar, as well as immoral and corrupt 

How does Martin seem to answer the problem of evil? 

- Evil has always existed and is a part of human nature – “always have the same nature” 
- Evil is a part of human nature that we need to accept, not something that we should attempt to philosophise away 
- Nihilism – lack of clear meaning or purpose 
- Empiricism, a posteriori (philosophy comes after experience) 
# ch 22 questions
Class answers in *, mine in paragraph

1.
How does the tone change in this chapter compared to the ones preceding it? E.g. more/less realistic, satirical, etc 
- More realistic, rather than fantastical (e.g. Eldorado and the use of myth/legend), satire based on real, rather than speculative, events 
- More believable and relatable and therefore more satirical 
- Candide’s optimism as he arrives in France and is undermined by the anticlimactic, bathetic nature of Paris itself 

The tone changes to much more satirical and realistic in the apparent normality of events. Whereas before Candide was in Eldorado and flaunting his money after he left, now he is in Paris and being cheated of his money in a very obvious way. It is more realistic in that Candide's misfortunes are more believably simple and more satirical because of this. The contrast between the two modes of realism allow Voltaire's current satire of Optimism and society to be just as effective but more believable.

2.
How are Martin and Candide's philosophical differences shown in this chapter? 
- Candide still clings to optimistic hope of finding Cunegonde – counterintuitive? 
- Martin sees the scams in Paris as foreshadowing future evil, unlike Candide who sees his reunion with her as a source of hope and restoration 
- Candide’s innocence/naivete shown throughout this chapter – too trusting 

When both Martin and Candide exclaim, "That is a lot," to the corresponding numbers of five to six thousand and fifteen to sixteen plays. This shows how Candide stays in awe at everything, only wanting to know the overall picture, and Martin has a very pessimistic and uninterested view on identifying the bad parts and expecting very little good to remain.

3.
How is the abbe presented and satirised in this section of the novel? 
- Embodies the trickery and theatrical deceit of Paris. Despite being from a good background, he still longs for wealth, fame, influence (as do the other Parisian characters) 
- Difference between helpful exterior and true motives 
- His association with the church suggests the underlying desire for power and wealth, even in those in religious roles 
- Taking advantage of Candide, e.g. takes a cut of Candide’s losses when gambling, fake Cunegonde scheme, stealing Candide’s jewels 

The abbe is presented as wanting to con Candide of his money throughout their entire interaction. Even while he is entertaining Candide and Martin he is attempting to appear more respectable, "not the man to effect an introduction...Mademoiselle Clairon moved only in superior circles" yet lies about her being "occupied" to not appear as inferior and even seem acquainted with her, and he only takes an interest in Candide for his money. He pretends to want Candide to experience Paris but takes him to lose 50 000 francs and coaxes him into revealing everything he needs to stage Cunegonde's illness. This satires the abbe as only being interested in personal gain and lying his way to gain influence and money, even more so as he is well known to the Marquise and presumably has done this with her before.

4.
"Take any contradiction or inconsistency you can imagine, and you will find examples of it in the government, the courts, the churches and the theatres of this ridiculous nation." (p.61-2) What examples of this behaviour do we see in this chapter?
- Satire/attacks on all institutions, such as the Church 
- Undermines Candide’s optimistic view of Paris 
- Undermines the views of Enlightenment that man is inherently orderly and reasonable 
- Attacks low quality of Parisian plays, suggesting they are motivated by easiness and money 

The officer who comes to arrest the "suspicious foreigners" and later releases Martin and Candide on a bribe is an example. Even more when he says,  "had you committed every imaginable crime, you are still the most honourable" and releases him after being given three diamonds.
The theatre-goers who criticise the play and the actors and then criticise people who criticise art and theatre is another example and a satire of the hypocrisy of  the snobbery in art circles.

5.
How does Voltaire present the literary and intellectual worlds of Paris? 
- Participants are motivated by self-interest, rather than intellectual merit and what will benefit society 
- Supposed ‘intellectuals’ still ready to take advantage of Candide 
- Motivated by wealth and corruption, just like everyone else  
- Candide and Martin ignored until their wealth is known 
- The most intelligent thing they do is creating scams to extort money from others 
- Underwhelming, unextraordinary dinner is aggrandised by the arrogance of the characters 

Voltaire presents them as highly hypocritical and stifling, and that most of them are simply sophists trying to appear clever and pass the time in privileged circles. This is exemplified in the phrase, "insipid witticisms, false news, pointless argument, a little politics and a quantity of slander". Voltaire satirises the pretentiousness of the literary and intellectual worlds of criticising for the sake of slandering a person's name and as being mostly a money-making venue rather than an intellectual one, especially the Saloons.

6.
As he leaves France, Candide feels like "a man delivered from hell". What is so hellish about France in Voltaire's opinion? Think about how French society is presented throughout this chapter. 
- Salon as a microcosm of French society – everyone is out for money and self-interested, e.g. the government, individuals 
- Voltaire’s exile from France reflected in his negative presentation of the country 

Candide experiences almost the opposite to what he experiences in Eldorado.
He purposefully wants to arrive at France and visit Paris because everyone he meets is going there, in Eldorado he simply needed to keep travelling in the hope of arriving anywhere better than where he was. Candide is treated with hospitality and meets the most prominent members of society in Eldorado even though he is money-less and never has to pay, whereas in France he is unable to meet anyone in "superior circles", is treated with false and half-given hospitality to rob him, and has to pay much money even though he is very rich and can lose 50 000 francs without much thought. He also has to pay to leave and would've been forced to stay in the "darkest" cell, while in Eldorado he stayed at the palace and the King had engineers build an extraordinary and expensive method for them to leave. By contrasting Eldorado and France in this way, Voltaire satirises the hypocrisy, pedantry, and rudeness of French society in its many disputes between everyone.

# ch 23-25 questions
## 23
### How does Voltaire present England?
Voltaire presents England as wasting too much money on unnecessary wars and as carrying out injustices to appease the public.
England is presented as wanting to be superficially superior instead of caring about justice. Petty attempts to conquer more territory instead of fixing their problems at home.
Martin says it is "a different type of madness" to France, but just as bad.
The madness in this case is about the state and authority, wheras in France it is social madness.
Comparison to France: instead of being opulent and excessive it is dark, "gloomy", and restrained but violent.


## Chapter 24
### How does Voltaire create sympathy for Paquette?
Paquette hasn't been seen since the beginning of the novel.
All of things which the reader would assume were good to happen are subverted to be negative.
We hear she has been cured of syphilus but the consequences are worse.
There is much repetition to demonstrate how many times this has happened to her. There is no escape from mistreatment.
Everything is shown as pointless and having no purpose or positive consequence.
We see the effects of social hypocricy and satire which Voltaire has been building. Paquette is symbolic of the effects of social exploitation.
First person perspective.
### How is religion satirised in this chapter?
People in religious institutions shown as not actually believing in the religion or being forced.
Association of religion with promiscuity, prostitution, corruption, and exploitation. The hypocricy of organised religion.
Using religious institutions for personal gains, e.g. the Theatine monk's parents.
Theatine monk says he wants to attack the monastery and convert to Islam. Then suggests all the other monks are in similar situations. Suggests monks are not motivated by faith or accept religion anf live by its values
New perspective: earlier depictions of monks focus on their exploits and abusiveness, here we see them as also victims.
## Chapter 25
### “Wherever you look, you find only empty systems, and not a single thing of use.” (p.77) How is this to shown to be the case in the novel so far?
All the value and belief systems are shown as being false and meaningless, or useless and harmful.
### What is the significance of Pococuranté’s depiction in the novel?
- Think about what it suggests about Voltaire’s attitude towards criticism (especially in the context of the Enlightenment) and towards optimism?

Criticism also doesn't create happiness. Even though he seems to have no worries he is not happy because he is shown as unhappy and miseable.
Even though he has everything he could want, he still wants more.
What one person expects will make others happy (Candide) doesn't actually make the people who has them happy (Pococurante).
Lack of fulfillment, feels bored and empty.
Here is the supposed happiest man in Europe, and even he is not happy.
Foreshadowing Candide's possible reunion with Cunegonde, the pursuit is more important than the relationship.
# ch 26-27 paragraphs
## How are wealth and power presented in Chapters 26 and 27 of *Candide*?

Power is presented as a temporary and easily lost thing which is wrongly valued along with wealth. By chance, Candide and Martin find themselves in the presence of six deposed kings. Voltaire satires the idea that a king is the most powerful person in a country, and thus the institution of monarchy, by presenting six kings—each with an equal claim to sovereignty—at the same time, in the same place. By showing the deposed kings as each being part of similarly miserable lives like Candide’s, and their families all part of a struggle for power, the common idea that power makes a person more secure and stable is challenged by Voltaire. Each of the kings has a similar story of losing their immense power to someone else, so that they might gain it. Furthermore, the kings themselves gained their power by someone else losing it. This goes to show that power is presented as transferable and easily lost. While each king is treated with respect by their servants, the display of reverence seems ironic and false after each king reveals he has been deposed and lost all dignity. The kings still wish to keep their appearance of power and do so with their servants. The sixth king’s misfortunes go to present power as definitively not fixed to one person. He loses all his power and might “spend the night in prison” if he is “not careful”, showing that the power of the individual, however great it might have been, is never permanent and never greater than the power of a group. Martin’s comment that “it is quite common for kings to be deposed” further brings the satire on royal power, and Candide’s wonder that one of them “had to accept alms from” him strengthens the presentation of claims to power as ultimately meaningless.

Wealth is similarly presented. Candide is able to “give a hundred times as much” as each of the kings despite being a “mere commoner”, and the disbelief of the kings that such a wealthy person could actually give this much to someone else satires the view that wealth comes with power and the legitimacy of kings. The “regal compassion” which moved the kings to donate two sequins each for the poorest king to buy some clothes and shirts is ridiculed as not true compassion, but an attempt of the kings to maintain their power as someone greater than the “commoner” by a display of wealth, which is then mocked unknowingly by Candide. Wealth and power are further presented as a vice of humans who hopelessly try to gain and keep it. The Levanite captain frees his slaves and changes his course for a diamond, and Candide is concerned with Cunegonde’s material riches when he tells Cacambo, “No doubt you have bought her a palace in Constantinople”. Instead of being worried primarily with Cunegonde’s well-being, Candide is more concerned that she is living in luxury with the wealth which he thinks can solve all problems. Although Candide is able to get most of the things he asks for with his wealth, he is often robbed of its true value—”sold him a diamond worth a hundred thousand sequins for fifty thousand”—and is not able to get what he really wants: he does not gain Cunegonde or Pangloss or the Baron back as they were, no amount of money could fix what they’ve experienced, and the king he helps will still be in dept and not a king in power. Cacambo’s given wealth being completely lost in freeing Cunegonde and being “casually relieve[d]” from by pirates further presents wealth as easy to lose and gain. The captain’s rash altering of the course to Constantinople before Candide could finish upon hearing the offer of fifty thousand sequins is an example of the willingness to do anything for more wealth and power. Finally, wealth and power are portrayed as ultimately insignificant to what they represent: Candide pays more to free two slaves than he does to the king. This both mocks the value of wealth and the significance what power is worth and deserves.

1. What do you think is meant by the closing line of the novel?
Candide changing his views. We have to work for and accept what we get, not expect for everything to be the best. Instead of passively waiting for perfection, actively trying to improve without any expectation that it will be perfect.
Instead of fousing on thinking/useless philosophy, we should focus on pragmatic and useful philosophy.
Less focus on the abstract "that is well said" and more on the practical "cultivate"
Being in the moment, contrast between Pangloss' reflection on their extraordinary adventure and Candide's focus on the immediate.
