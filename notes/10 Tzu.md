# 10 Tzu
"Human nature is evil"
- we are born with "feelings of envy and hate"
- Pursuing these leads to violence and crime

The only way to overcome our nature we must do a conscious activity



If we have no “ritual principles to guide” us, we will lack order and be perverse and violent.



## Ritual principles

Rules and rituals needed in society.

- The existence of them shows that human nature is real because if it was good we would naturally do them
  - They exist therefore necessary?

## Emotional nature

- Emotional nature is a subsection of human nature.
- An example is someone desiring food when they are hungry.

We overcome and run contrary to nature and emotion for ritual principles (e.g. respect)

Without these rules there would be no courtesy or humility

Tzu defines ‘goodness’ as “that which is upright, reasonable, and orderly” 

- He defines ‘evil’ as “that which is prejudiced, irresponsible, and chaotic” 



## Tzu v Menicus

## How evil humans make good ritual principles
