The denial of teleology


## Kierkegaard
Similarities with nietzche:
- both deny teleology
- both strive for authenticity
- both go against the value system they are in, kierkegaard does hegelianism and nietzche does entire realm of philosophy
- both strive to finding and making meaning

Differences:
- kierkegaard as a responce to nietzche: nietzche living in the Aesthetic and denying the Ethical, he constructs his own value system but it is meaningless.
- kierkegaard is a fideist theological positivist

"paragraph" response to the following: if you cannot prove there is meaning in the universe, what should you believe?

If one denies teleology, then one must question the underlying value systems held as true. The angst which arises from this existential questioning and deconstruction of the episteme's value system allows one the attempt to arrive at an authentic conclusion; this conclusion may be the construction of a new value system where one creates their own meaning, or the denial of everything in a life-denying nihilistic conclusion. However, one must question why this conclusion is reached and if it truly is an authentic reflection: in the case of life denying nihilism, there is no such thing as authenticity. Aside from the contradiction of being authentic when there can be no authenticity, it is impossible to not form or adopt a value system. The irony of life denying-nihilism is that it adopts the social slave-morality of the current value system in trying to reject it, yet twists it to deny the experiences possible from being "thrown into the world" which even this system allows a muted experience of. Not only would one fall into the system which promotes futility, one intentionally goes out of the way to never experience what life can bring. One can believe in anything, but it must be something.

Furthermore, one can view this lack of teleology as removing any quest for God, yet the true existential angst arises from the noticing of the unprovability and distance of God. To simply reject God is the easy way which avoids any further existential questioning: one simply denies God, as the life-denying nihilist does everything. This is not to say that theism is the conclusion from a denial of teleology, for the position that "God exists" is not necessary for the quest towards God. However, one must recognise the transcendence of God from existence, and faith in this absurd quest to know God while neither existing nor not existing results in true, self-created meaning.

The simple creation of meaning for the self is not enough, one must recognise the fundamental falsity of this meaning and therefore make the quest for meaning the aim of life itself, meaning of which can only be discovered in a suspension of reason for the faith in something greater. That "Man is a useless passion" must be fully embraced, instead of the atheistic existentialist thought, the lack of teleology and passion for God ought to lose the self. It is in this denial of self, which Sartre criticises, that true meaning is found: not a meaning created inauthentically and trying to be authentic, but an authentic meaning created by denying the self because of recognising its ego as narcissistically being inauthentic. Therefore, one must believe in the quest for meaning through God or something greater, inevitably fail, and make this absurd quest the foundation for a self-less value system.
