# 38 SEP Circularity and Descartes

## Notes
Indirect doubt
> How, then, is it possible to doubt such matters? According to one interpretation, the answer is that we cannot doubt them directly, however, we can doubt them in an indirect manner. That is, rather than directing the doubt at particular such propositions, as that I exist, or that 2+3=5, the doubt is instead directed at the cognitive faculties by which we apprehend such propositions. By way of analogy, consider that if a calculator were defective, it would cast doubt on any calculations it generated. Likewise, if my own mind were in some sense defective, this would cast doubt on any matters I apprehended â€“ no matter how evident those matters might seem. By directing the doubt at the veracity of my own cognitive faculties, I do thereby indirectly doubt the particular propositions apprehended by means of those faculties.

### 6.1 The Cartesian Circle

A longstanding (and most likely incorrect) interpretation of Descartes involves the worry that he presupposes the rule that CDP are true in his effort to prove the CDP rule. Scholarship tends to resist this vicious circularity interpretation based on textual consideration; putting these aside, it is surprising that the central argument of the project would be circular.

CDP -(proves)-> God
- M3, p40, par 4, "from the mere fact that I exist and have within me an idea of a most perfect being, that is, God, provides a very clear proof that God indeed exists."

God -(provides)-> CDP
- M4, p49, par 4, "This is because every clear and distinct perception is undoubtedly something [real and positive (in Fr version)], and hence cannot come from nothing but must necessarily have God for its author".
- M4, p47, Final par, "the power of understanding or the natural light which God gave me".

Every plausible interpretation must concede that the two main steps of the broader argument unfold in a manner *suggestive* of a circle. Let them be called arcs.

M3 arguments for God define the first arc
> **Arc 1**: The conclusion that an all-perfect God exists is derived from premises that are clearly and distinctly perceived.

M4 defines a second arc
> **Arc 2**: The general veracity of propositions which are clearly and distinctly perceived (the C&D Rule/CDR) is derived from the conclusion that an all-perfect God exists.

The question that arises is whether these arcs form an epistemic circle.

Arc 1 has considerable ambiguity, how this is resolved determines whether the arcs strictly form a circle.

To generate a vicious circle Arc 1 must mean that
> *1A*: i.e., conclusion is derived from premises that are accepted only because of having first accepted the CDR.
> **Arc 2**

Interpreted in this way, the argument *is* circular. 1A clarifies Arc 1 in such a way that it is circular.

This interpretation means that Descartes begins M3 with the presupposition the general truth of propositions that are clearly and distinctly perceived (CDR).

One point of agreement in the secondary literature is that the texts do not sustain this interpretation.

There are 2 main kind of non-circular strategies that are attributed to Descartes.

#### Bounded Doubt interpretations

> *1B*: conclusion is derived from CDP premises--indeed, premises belonging to a special class of truths that are fully immune to doubt prior to establishing the general veracity of CDP propositions.
> **Arc 2**

1B clarifies Arc 1 by construing hyperbolic doubt as *bounded*. In this reading, Evil Deceiver Doubt is bounded in the sense that its skeptical power doesn't extend to all judgements: there is a special class of truths outside the bounds of doubt. The premises of M3 proofs for God are within this category. These special propositions can be perfectly known, even by atheists.

There is a special doubt-proof class of premises prior to accepting CDR. (premise "God exists" as analytic)

There is no circularity with Bounded Doubt interpretation because the truths serving as premises in the argument for CDR are perfectly knowable *independently* of that rule. i.e., the premises employed throughout Arcs 1 and 2 count as perfectly knowable *prior* to the knowledge of the CDR they help establish.

M3 difference between what is *revealed by the natural light* and what is *taught by nature* is often emphasised. What is by the natural light is that special class of propositions which are outside the bounds of doubt.

To extend this class of truths escaping doubt beyond that which is revealed by the natural light, it's necessary to establish the general veracity of the CDR. This makes Arc 2 necessary in the overall project.

Supporters of this view must consider the problem of why the Evil Deceiver Doubt's power doesn't extend to propositions in this special class. Why does it undermine propositions such as "two and three added together make five," but *not* the proposition "that there must be at least as much [reality] in the efficient and total cause as in the effect of that cause?"

The first is included in the examples which *are* undermined, while the second is a premise in M3 argument for God--a proposition immune to doubt, in the bounded doubt interpretations.

Given the *indirect* manner in which Evil Deceiver Doubt operates, there seems no clear explanation why doubt succeeds in the first but is somehow resisted by the second. 

More awkwardly, the *cogito* is included in the list of examples that the same fourth paragraph is vulnerable to doubt (in that the mind can chose to doubt it, but then this verifies it; if it were indubitable the mind could not but assent to it to begin with?)

#### Unboudned Doubt interpretations
> *1C*: i.e., conclusion is derived from premises that are accepted despite being vulnerable to Evil Deceiver Doubt, because our cognitive nature compels us to assent to clearly and distinctly perceived propositions

> **Arc 2**

1C adds to Arc 1 by construing hyperbolic doubt as *unbounded*. In this interpretation, Evil Deceiver Doubt is unbounded in the sense that it undermines *all* manner of judgements when the mind is no longer attending to them clearly and distinctly--even the cogito, even the premises of M3 proofs for God.

The meditator assents to the steps of the proofs not because of having an understanding of CDP as being guaranteed true, but because the mind *cannot but assent* to them *while* attending clearly and distinctly.

Importantly, if doubt is thus unbounded there is no circularity. The arguments in Arc 1 do not presuppose the general veracity of the CDR.

The premises contributing to the conclusion of an all-prefect God remain vulnerable to hyperbolic doubt, in this stage of the inquiry none of the meditator's judgements based in CDP constitutes perfect knowledge. It is the unboundedness of hyperbolic doubt that underwrites the No Atheistic Perfect Knowledge Thesis (no perfect knowledge as all these propositions can so far be doubted by EDe).

The reason why the arguments in Arc 1 are accepted by the meditator if Evil Deceiver Doubt is still in play lies in the way which doubt *indirectly* undermines CDP.

*While* clearly and distinctly attending to a proposition, the mind cannot but assent: "my nature is such that so long as I perceive something very clearly and distinctly I cannot but believe it to be true."

Therefore, while attending to the steps of M3 arguments for God, the meditator cannot but accept them. However, the meditator doesn't yet have perfect knowledge of these premises nor their conclusions.

Those who hold this view must adress the problem of why the Evil Deceiver Doubt eventually loses its undermining power, why doesn't the Evil Deceiver undermine the very arguments intended to refute the Evil Deceiver, as soon as the mind is no longer attending to these premises (given it is unbounded and indirect)?

At the point in which we are no longer CDPing the steps of an argument, it no longer holds the power in which we cannot but assent to it. It is at this point where hyperbolic doubt does its undermining work.

This means it is possible to run the Evil Deceiver on the conclusions of Arcs 1 and 2 as soon as attention is diverted from the premises.

Self-Evident God interpretation purports to solve this problem.

### 6.2 Self-Evident God interpretation
Answer unbounded.
Newman and Nelson, 1999.

Descartes rejects that we could overcome the problem via uninterrupted CDP, "my nature is such that I cannot fix my mental vision continually on the same thing, so as to keep perceiving it clearly; and often the memory of a previously made judgement may come back, when I am no longer attending to the arguments which led me to make it."

In this moment of inattention, an indirect doubt remains possible so long as we can make sense of an Evil Deceiver or any scenario wherein we have a defective cognitive nature.

It therefore seems that a final solution would need to make it no longer possible to make sense of these scenarios. We come to an utterly basic apprehension that we're the creation of an all-prefect creator who would not allow us to be deceived about what we clearly and distinctly perceive.

This needed apprehension of god needs to be self-evident.

If we suppose it is grounded in a demonstration, it's possible to think of the conclusion of that demonstration without also thinking of the premises; on such occasions, the confidence in the demonstration is vulnerable to indirect hyperbolic doubt. So the needed apprehension must be a self-evident, clear and distinct conception that renders the very skeptical scenarios that underwrite indirect doubt as literally unthinkable.

There is a useful analogy to what is needed in the doubt-resisting character of the cogito due to being a self-verifying thought. If one attempts a direct doubt of existence, the effort is self-stultifying. What Descartes needs is a similarly strong and immediately doubt-resisting outcome in connection with attempts at an *indirect* doubt.

Multiple texts suggest this is the account Descartes intends to achieve, and that M5 is where the meditator finds an enhanced apprehension of god.

M5 introduces ideas of innate truths and repeated meditation. Truths initially noticed only by means of inference might eventually come to be apprehended self-evidently.

"Some of the things I clearly and distinctly perceive are obvious to everyone, while others are discovered only by those who look more closely and investigate more carefully; but once they have been discovered, the latter are judged to be just as certain as the former."
Example of the right-angled triangle, that the Pythagorean theorem is not so readily apparent as the fact that the hypotenuse subtends the largest angle, but once one sees it it is as apparent.

"But as regards God, if I were not overwhelmed by preconceived opinions, and if the images of things perceived by the senses did not besiege my thought on every side, I would certainly acknowledge him sooner and more easily than anything else. For what is more self-evident..."

Descartes seems to suggest that one's apprehension of God eventually changes from inferential to transparently self-evident. If the meditator has achieved this kind of apprehension of God, it plausibly explains why Descartes would think he's achieved a final solution to the skeptical problem.

Given his newfound epistemic standing, the meditator would be unable to make coherent sense of Evil Genius Doubt. His CDP would be fully indubitable, thereby counting as perfect knowledge.

### 6.3 Another Cartesian Circle?

Michael Della Rocca recently argued that a further circle arises from considerations in M4. Della Rocca focuses on a twofold question:
> Why, for Descartes, should we not assent to ideas that are not clear and distinct and why is there no such obligation not to assent to clear and distinct ideas? The reason Descartes offers seems to be that we should not assent to ideas that are not clear and distinct because they, unlike clear and distinct ideas, are not guaranteed to be true. (2011, 96)

Two questions:
1. Why should we not assent to ideas that are not CDP? And,
2. Why is there no such obligation not to assent to CDP ideas?

Descartes seems to say that:

1. We shouldn't assent to non-CDP ideas because they are not guaranteed to be true, unlike CDP ideas.


As Della Rocca understands M4, the claim that we should only assent to what we clearly and distinctly perceive is an essential step in the ongoing argument to establish divine guarantee of CDP. Since this step presupposes the eventual conclusion, that conclusion is based on circular reasoning.

1. Clear and distinct ideas are guaranteed to be true
2. Therefore We should only assent to clear and distinct ideas
... (arcs, or whatever)
3. Clear and distinct ideas are true.

The point of circularity is Della Rocca's interpretation that Descartes' reason for saying that we should assent only to CDP ideas is that they are guaranteed to be true, and that ideas that are not CDP are not guaranteed to be true. While this interpretation is possible, there is another perhaps more textually supported one.

M1, meditator resolves to withhold assent to anything which is "not completely certain and indubitable".

Early in M3, having reflected on the epistemic impressiveness of the cogito, the meditator discovers that *all*, but *only*, CDP are utterly assent-compelling.

As a practical consequence, this means he should only assent to CDP, not because of presupposing the conclusion of the CDR but because those are the only perceptions to which he *can't but* assent to (you can link to unbounded doubt).

This provides a practical answer to Della Rocca's question of
1. Why should we not assent to ideas that are not CDP? And,
2. Why is there no such obligation not to assent to CDP ideas?

Then, in M4, the meditator purports to demonstrate the divine guarantee of the CDR. However, no premise in that demonstration presupposes that CDP have been established as true, only that they cannot be but assented to, due to our nature.

i.e., the conclusion of this demonstration is not based on the claim that CDP are guaranteed to be true (and this is not the reason why they are assented to either).
