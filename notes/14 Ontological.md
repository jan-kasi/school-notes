# 14 Ontological
Anselm puts forwards a second version of the argument as a response and acceptance of Gaunilo's criticism to the first version

## Anselm's 1st
1. God is greatest concievable being
2. Things exist in the mind or in mind and reality
3. It is greater to exist in mind and reality than just in mind

2. Suppose that God exists only in the mind
  1. We can imagine a greater being than God, one which exists in both
  2. There is a greater being than the greatest being
3. [2] is a contradiciton, therefore God exists in reality


## Gaunilo's response


## Anselm's revised 2nd version of his Ontological Argument

Necessary vs Contingent introduced into Western philosophy


PROBLEM: existence is not a predicate
- Further problem: if existence be not a predicate, what be existence?
