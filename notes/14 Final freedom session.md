# 14 Final freedom session
## Heroin
If you take a lot of heroin and you feel like you really want more heroin, so you buy more heroin, was that a free choice?

Substitute the word 'heroin' for McNuggets. Was *that* a free choice?

Change this to something else? Are we not all addicted to *something*?

## Frankfurtâ€”First and Second Order Desires

First Order: Desire for something other than a desire. E.g. McNuggets, shelter, peace; these are determined and in the case of heroin, physical, allows no freedom. This is where animals operate

Second/Higher Order: opens the door to freedom but acknowledges determinism. A desire for a desire. So you might have a first order desire to smoke a cigarette  and for a second order desire that you might not want to smoke a cigarette. A second order desire may or may not correspond to the first order to be effective.

Thus I might want to give all my money to charity, but I might nonetheless not want to actually want that desire to be effective.

When a person does not want the first order to be effective, when they want it to be their will, this is a second order volition.

Frankfurt is therefore a compatibalist. If you bring together your 1st and 2nd order desires then you are free.
