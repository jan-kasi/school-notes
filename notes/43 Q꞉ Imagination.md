a. Explain the role of imagination in Descartes' theory of knowledge.
b. Evaluate the role of imagination in Descartes' theory of knowledge.

ontological relies on imagination (M5?) imagination of triangle gives knowledge of concept of triangle dependent on real things we then "see in the mind's eye".


M2: distinguishing ideas, intellect.
M4: Error theory
M5: triangle
M6: chileagon, "**see...in my mind's eye**, as if they were present before me; and this is what I call imagining.", "power of imagining...not necessary...of my mind", 


in M6, "act of understanding (intellectio) is distinguished from that of the imagination (imaginatio). The distinction between intellectio and imaginatio has the distinction between mind and body as a central function.

Imagination is reliant on senses therefore body, but is part of the mind.

 --(senses)--> Body --(perception)--> _Intellect_
                                        intellect ---> _Creates_
                                              _[big, lizard, wings, fire]_ ---> _dragon_
                                              _dragon_ <--(judgement by the will. real/not real. error.)--

Imagination proves the mind/body exist (perhaps the distinction, but maybe not) and also links in to error.
