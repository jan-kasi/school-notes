# 02 The Philosophy of Free Will
Masolit Lecture: notes
## Introduction

- Are we in control of our actions?
- Is it up to us what we do?
  - Why this might matter morally and for ethics
  - If we have a right to liberty
- What reason do we have to believe in freedom?

***

## What is free will?

Free will is a kind of power over actions.

- Power is a special kind of capacity
  - To make or prevent events
  - To produce or determine outcomes
- Causation is a type of power.
  - Throwing a brick at a window: the brick has the capacity to break the window.

Free will looks very much like causation, another capacity to make things happen.

- But, taking the brick analogy, the brick has only one capacity. We have more than one capacity to do one thing.

Power to determine more than one outcome.

A “power over alternatives”

- We are free to do more than one thing.
- Different to ordinary causation as they can only do one thing, they have no alternatives.

- Control over “external” or “voluntary” actions.
  - Voluntary because they are in effect of a prior “will” to perform them

This psychological state of intention motivates one to take this action.

This capacity to take decisions and form intentions is what is called “the will”.

- We also control whether we **decide** what we do.

Freedom starts of as a power over the Will to take decisions and form a state to take an action.



If the psychological states which move one to do something weren’t decisions one controlled and were just passive feelings which controlled one:

- What determines one to do something is an uncontrollable urge.
- Not in control over action at all.



Freedom depends on a capacity to take active decisions which we control.

## Problem with Free Will

Causation creates a problem of whether free will can ever exist.

It creates a skepticism about free will: our natural belief in freedom is without foundations and we might even have reason to abandon belief in freedom.

We still limited by external things but we still assume control and freedom over decisions.

Freedom as Power over alternatives:

- Being able to determine more than one action.
- Dependant on there being an alternative

## Does the problem matter?

- It matters for its own sake
- Matters to ethics:
  - Blame and punishment
  - Human rights

| Moral responsibility                                         | Liberty                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| We don’t just criticise immoral actions, we also put down their actions as **their** fault. | Coercion.                                                    |
| We put down their fault as their own actions.                | A right to liberty—to not be coerced.                        |
| They have some responsibility for being that way/acting that way. | A power over freedom, to have control over what we do.       |
| We link this to their capacity of action.                    | The right to have control one’s actions cannot exist without the power of freedom existing. |
| Faults that are peoples’ faults have arisen in them from their own doing as they have a capacity to determine how they act. They are responsible for their actions and the results of them. | Liberty based on the capacity to exercise the power of freedom and have a right to do so. |
| This is only true if the power of freedom is a power they have. | If we don’t have a capacity to determine what we do, we can’t have a right to do so. |
| If there is no such thing we can only point out the fault but or hold them morally responsible. They are not faults blamed on the person, they are just faults *in* the person. |                                                              |
| Punishment based on blaming the person for having a moral responsibility due to their power of freedom but choosing doing wrong, so they are deserving of the punishment.<br />If there is no power of freedom then they cannot be held as deserving of punishment for something, it would be like a vase deserving punishment for having a crack or not being perfect and us punishing it for this. |                                                              |

## Protecting Ethics from the Free Will Problem

### Blame and punishment

Suppose that all human actions are causally determined.

What is important is that humans be causally prevented from committing actions which harm other human beings/are immoral/whatever.

So we institute practices of blame and punishment which act as causes which benefit/serve a social purpose, they deter them from doing the actions.

So we only blame and punish people who are receptive to them to prevent these things from happening, or for whom doing this will prevent them from.

- Therefore we don’t blame or punish those who are not receptive or for whom it won’t discourage/prevent because it won’t deter this action.
  - e.g. some mentally ill people (perhaps).

Blame in ethics has good effects even in a causally determined system by encouraging good actions and discouraging bad ones.

### Right to Liberty

Hobbes: Liberty is simply the silence of the law. (we don’t have a power of freedom)

- Liberty is the space left where coercive law doesn’t impose obligations on us. That is where we have a right to liberty.

- This is unsatisfactory if we want right to liberty to limit law: it is a right that limits what the law can do, not the space left after law.

Reason: reason is a capacity to understand and respond to justifications

- Right to liberty is based on the capacity to respond to arguments and justifications.

- Coercion doesn’t treat us with the respect deserved for reason.
  - Ignores capacity to reason and just issues threats.

Issue with reason:

- Coercer isn’t ceasing to argue or reason, they are providing a different type of argument
  - Producing a threat as a justification by producing an effect.
  - It is not a substitute for argument, it is a different type of argument. It uses the capacity to make your life worse, and poses this as the argument for the coercion.

## Does Freedom exist and what is it like?

Nonscientific method:

- Begs the question of incompatibalism.
  - Even if decisions are causally determined by events in our brains then that doesn’t mean there is no power of freedom (compatibalism v incompatibalism).

How do we find if compatibalism or incompatibalism is true?

Is power of freedom even existent?

- We observe power of simple causation through inductive reasoning.
  - Hume: what we see is regularities, a pattern in which we fit the event. We project this inference into the future expectation.
    - We see a sequence of events, not a power linking them. 
    - Causal power is a feature of the mind, how we think about something, not something we observe or is experienced.
  - Freedom is different to causation because it makes alternatives available, there is no regularity which reveals the power of freedom.
    - We can’t percieve it through regularity or detect it directly.
    - If Hume is right and power can only be observed through regularities, we can never find out about the power of freedom as it has no regularities.

- Hume may be wrong:
  - Causal powers exercised over us by motivations, desires, etc. outside the will itself is experienced by us and the other.
  - We feel the force of passive emotions pushing us to do things, e.g. anger, fear, exhaustion, in a way which makes us lose control.
  - Experience represents this external power of causation and internal power of freedom by the decrease in one.
  - Experience represents power to us.
