# 15 The Cogito
## Cottingham's position
For the purpose of the course, we will treat Cottingham's position as correct (also the academic consensus and what I think is most useful/probably)

Link to phenomenology?

The cogito is about *self **awareness***

Common misconceptions about the cogito:
= thinking
= wider thought

What the cogito is:
- consciousness/awareness/ (technical) intellect
- "*Inescapably* cognitive"

## Four common interpretations of the Cogito
1. Inference
2. Analytically true
3. Transcendental argument
4. Self-verifying thought (Cottingham's position)


### 1: Inference
This is wrong.

If the cogito is an inference, it can be put into the following format
1. To think one must exist
2. I am thinking
3. Therefore I exist

Cartesian Skepticism requires all sense perception to be doubted, 1. should be doubted
A posteriori

In the Second Replies, Descartes refutes this claim (and doesn't even formulate it in M2): "...he does not deduce existence from thought by means of a syllogism but recognises it as self-evident by simply intuition of the mind"

### 2: Analytically true
Problems: "existence is not a predicate"

Meditation 2: "*I am, I exist* is necessarily true, every time I express it or conceive of it in my mind".
Therefore, the cogito is not a truth about concepts, but a truth about the person conceiving the concepts at the moment.

Not about definitions or true by necessity, but about *the person* conceiving the *concepts* at that moment and *experience*.

### 3: Transcendental argument
Transcendental argument: if X is a precondition of doubt then it is impossible to doubt X---the argument "transcends" the concept; it deals with preconditions.

I cannot doubt without existing. Therefore if I believe I can doubt (all items of sense experience) then I must exist. "There is therefore no doubt that I exist, if he deceives me; and let him deceive me as much as he likes, he will never being it about that I am nothing [so long as I think that I am something]"

i.e.
Take the premises:
1. I doubt I exist
. To *doubt* I must exist (for one to doubt one must exist), and
3. To doubt *requires* existence (doubt itself requires existence within it)
4. Therefore, "I doubt I exist" = contradiction of concepts

Saying "I am a thinking thing/ I am, I exist" proves itself
This is not a logical thing, when one says it it is being experienced.

Kant says that the act of the cogito cannot be doubted, as this would verify it.

### Self-verifying thought
No logic (as Kant's has)

gets rid of the deceiveing demon, which can still apply to Kant's

Cogito is not subject to reason, it is true through experience and process, through the natural light. Logic is irrelevant. One can doubt the logic before (as it can be deception), but while one is doing cognition and through the cognitive process, it is true.

An advantage over Kants' idea of it (inside the Cartesian framework):
- Deceiving demon making one go wrong each time one does logic
- While one argues through the motion of transcendental arguments, it could be wrong
- So the idea of it being a transcendental argument is flawed in this way

Yet when one performs cognition and the cogito becomes necessarily true, not in the analytic sense, but in that it is inescapably so.
"inescapably cognitive".

It is true, "by the natural light".
