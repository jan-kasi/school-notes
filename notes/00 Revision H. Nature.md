# 00 Revision H. Nature

- Do humans share common characteristics that are independent of culture?
- Distinctions between animals and humans?
- Is there rationality?


1. Man is rational (Plato, Descartes)
  - Reason defines being human
  - What is reason?
	- Phenomenal/Experience seems to support conflict within desires. There is a desire to do something but also a contrary desire able to control it which seems to stem from a different source (base desire for water, and deciding not to drink poison. Example of smoking, base desire due to addiction, perhaps a desire to smoke due to anger/stress/emotive reasons, and reasoning not to for health reasons). We tend to be able to control these desires by thinking about things outside of impulse and make a judgement about which desires to allow. Even if not drinking poison/not smoking is also a desire, there seems to be a need for conscious choice in many instances.
	- But it may be a more refined and powerful set of desires, not a separate autonomous part. However, phenomenal experience suggests that often these desires conflict quite evenly or even one which is painful to chose is chosen for what are not the same category of desire. Perhaps reason then is preserved as acting with a very long term or refined desire (e.g. to live or to be right), so it may equally appear to be another desire, but the thing allowing us to chose this desire which may be more "telos" but weaker in force is ratio (allowing us to proportionally see things and make a judgement outside of the desire's pure strength). Game theory link problems: is it rational to prioritise one's own survival or try to maximise the groups's? Example of other species too. What is rational does not seem to absolute but dependant on circumstance/value-systems (link to Foucault) and how Power is involved.
 - Critique possible with AI more difficult but possible. Learning algorhythms do not have desires, but are capable of superior ratio (if understood as making a decision objectively), but they do not have anamnesis.

2. Man is irrational (Darwin, Freud, Nietzsche, Foucault)
  - Perhaps we are not unique in this regard
  - Unifying condition is irrationality, even if not unique

	- Hobbes: reason is no more than a complex calculation involving concepts we have created, limited by how we see the world. Reason does not offer certainty. To say that humans are rational is just saying that humans are good at calculating costs and benefits using imperfect concepts. Link to Nietzche perspectivism? 
 - Hume: reason is based on irrationality and emotions. 
- Foucault critique mentioned above. Link to Khun perhaps. 

3. Man is a blank slate (Locke, Marx, Butler)
  - Shaped by experience and learning is a unifying condition.


Intuition/Deduction thesis accepted?
Probably yes for me, so accept humans are rational as we seem to use more than just experience/complete irrationality. Even if it is not a distinguishing feature or such a thing as a unifying human nature, humans may still be rational.
