# 01 Intro
Rationalist

establish truth and conclusivity, a basis for physics and maths etc.

doubt as an exercise to clear away the rubble

trademark argument

the finitude of humans and infinite nature of god

body as extension

mind as indescribable

mathematician at heart, "I accept all of this mathematics, but why is it true?"

lover of optics

some things must be established by experience, but many things can be discovered by careful use of the intellect

cogito ergo sum is a very private starting point, he needed to get outside of this to the extensional world. He uses God for this.
cogito ergo deus est.

Descartes is an inheritor of the Medieval Catholic Tradition from Spain and probably "borrowed" from Islamic thought and the works of St Theresa of Avila.
