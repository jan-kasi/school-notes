# ch 02-04
## Candide:
- unaware
- easily manipulated
- too trusting, naive, and unprepared
- doesn't recognise reality of situations because of his Optimism
  - unable to respond to the real situations
- "in vain did he remonstrate with them about freedom of the will" p.7
- ridiculousness of thinking he is free as he has a choice of which punishment to take
  - he is not even free
    - if anything, this choice makes Candide less free
- "a young metaphysician entirely unschooled in the ways of the world"
  - a useless philosophy (abstract and no function in world (or so Voltaire says))
  - satirical tone

## The Army:
- ironic "hero" descriptions
- part of a system
- insututionalised in army
  - conditioned into army
  - contrary to Englightenment thought
- corporal punishment
- authoritarianism
- violation of freedom
- "he trembled like a philosopher"


goes from a slightly sarcastic & satirical tone to a very immediate and visual reality of the horrors of war
- explained so punctually and without displayed emotion
- Candide out of his depth
- ironic optimism
  - optimism which is harmful and diminishes the victim's suffering
- "various heroes"
- murder and brutaliy of innocents
(described similarly to how Goya's art about war looks)

- futility
  - lack of victory (100 years war)

## Anabaptist:
- nonconformist
- tolerant
- doesn't stereotype
- nuanced

## pangloss:
- horrors of war
- how it also affected Candide even though he did not think it did
- murder of the Baron's family
- Pangloss' syphilis
- chain of transmission of siphilis
  - satire of Leibniz' cause and effect chain
    - "Franciscan" - order of St Francis & "Jesuit" - Jesuit order
      - religious hypocricy, preached celibacy, poverty, aesteticism etc. but did not do so themselves (if anything they did the opposite)
    - parody of Biblical genealogies, Candide even calls it, "a strange genealogy"




## piquaresque elements:
- short chapters
- cliffhangers



## context:
- 1755 Lisbon Earthquake
- Almost completely destroyed Lisbon
- Occured on Catholic holiday of All-Saints' Day, so some viewed it ass a religiously significant event
  - inquisitors do so in Candide
- problem of evil
