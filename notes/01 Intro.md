# 01 Intro

- Has aspects of the picaresque novel
- but a bildensrauman

- Banned immediately after it was published due to its blasphemy and political outspokenness

## Picaresque novel
Thrall and Hibbard
- normally in first person, presented as a pseudo-autobiographical novel
- not much of a cohesive unifying plot
- not much character development, character doesn't change
- Satire
- Tends to be immoral/outside of the law, but we are meant to side with them (like a mischiveous anti-hero)

1554: The life of Dariso De Tormes (?)
1594: ...?
1604: El Buson
1605: Don Quixote
1722: Moll Flanders

## The Enlightenment
Voltaire is writing in the age of Enlightenment
One of the philosophes (one of "the thinkers")
  - Politically charged in some way

## Characters
Candide
- simple young man
- optimistic
- Candide = white/pure: naivety, innoccence
Cunengonde
- Beautiful unnatainable woman Candide is in love with
Pangloss
- = leibniz
- pan+gloss in greek -> all+tongue/ all talk
- Largest point of satire
- teaches Candide and Cunengode, brainswashing them into optimism and leaving them unprepared
Paguette
- has a brief affair with Pangloss/Candide (?) and gives him syphilis
- he justifies this with optimism

## Key themes

## Leibniz
