# 28 Meditation 4

## 43-44
"I know by experience I am prone to countless errors".
e.g. sensory doubt in wave 1

"Error as such is not something real which depends on God, but merely a defect."
A defect is something wrong in the external world

"the faculty of true judgement which I have from God is in my case not infinite"
Otherwise I would be right of everything

"He always wills what is best"


## 44-45

Error can be contained in 2 places:
1. Faculty of knowledge (intellect)
  - Pure intellectual acts require no accompanying process, therefore these are passive.
  - Other intellectual acts --requiring the presence of the body--e.g. sense perception, imagination, and corporeal memory.
  - That which goes into the vessel is what is wrong, it is not an error of the intellect, i.e. not a problem of you, it is an error of the data (by sense perception or what is putting it in)

2. The faculty of choice (will)
  - Will is the ability to affirm or deny the truth of the perception to make judgements
  - Will acts on the intellect to make a judgement
  - This could be mistaken

## 46-47
"The scope of the will is wider than that of the intellect; but instead of restricting it within the same limits, I extend its use to matters which I do not understand. Since the will is indifferent in such cases, it easily turns aside from what is true and good, and this is the source of my error of sin."
The will roams and tries to take over areas outside its limits, it acts over judgement in things it doesn't understand.
Descartes might mean a colloquial use as he claims judgement is part of it ("do not understand"). This links to the Christian doctrine of humans being fallen, imperfect by nature. It acts over everything and we use imperfectly when it should only be limited to acting on the intellect's clear perceptions.

See also 47, "If, however, I simply refrain..." to the end of that paragraph.

Descartes is arguing that the source of error is the incorrect application of the will to make judgement on things which we do not clearly or distinctly perceive by the intellect.
  - If we take the wrong position, then we are obviously in error.
  - If we take the correct position, then we arrive at it by chance and we are still in error as it is "clear by the natural light that the perception of the intellect should always precede the determination of the will".
  
i.e. it is an incorrect overapplication of the will on things which are not clearly perceived which is the error, it ought to be the case that a clear perception precedes the application of will.

Therefore error lies in the "operation of the will in so far as it proceeds from me, but not in the faculty of will which I received from God, nor even in its operation, in so far as it depends on him."

The scope of the will is what the will is intended to be used for/the correct use of the will, what it is able to apply to. It is only to be used on things which we have "sufficiently clear knowledge" for.
  - Scope = the range of things it can apply to/function on.
	- The will can sometimes act on things without information out of confusion or ignorance.
	- Confusion: lack of distinction between ideas. Lack of clear ideas/clarity.
	- Ignorance: link to Aquinas; vincible ignorance (can be changed, immoral to willingly be wrong and not change this, error from these is human fault), invincible ignorance (can't be changed. Not immoral to be vincibly ignorant, but it is your own error to use the will on such ideas).

Link to philosophy of religion of God "letting" people make these wrong decisions/allowing us to apply the will incorrectly.
Assumptions about God's nature?


Links to psychology of overestimating one's ability
Links to Augustinian theodicy, free will given to humans, humans are fallen as seminally present, and so on and so forth.


Counters possible as he takes the good Jesuit boy position.



## 47-49 Error is no poor reflection on God
"And I have no cause for complaint" 47
I am finite and therefore my intellect will be too, I shouldn't challenge why God did not give me a greater intellect

"Nor do I have any cause for complaint on the grounds..." 48
I shouldn't challenge why will extends more widely than my intellect--will is indivisible by nature it cannot be reduced.

"Finally I must not complain..." 48
I shoudn't assert I made mistakes due to God--I am responsible for the privation of truth, not God. God gave us freedom--it is on me to reign in my will and thus find greater truth.


**Akrasia**
Human spirit is fallen because human is divided as body and soul, akrasia is the fall making the soul/body being misbalanced. The body overrules the soul.
