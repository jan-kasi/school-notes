## Ship of Theseus
> Theseus owned a ship and the ship was made entirely from wood. He sailed around the ocean for many years in his ship. Every time a part needed replacing it was replaced with a metal part. This went on for a few yaears until eventually it was entirely replaced.

Q1: Is the ship of Theseus the same ship of theseus it was when first built?

I say, YES:
While it is not the same ship in that it has the same materials/physical thing, it is still the same ship in that the ship of theseus is the ship which we call thesus' ship. The ship is theseus' ship not because of what it is but because of what we ascribe to it. 
To theseus, the ship is his ship if he considers it the same ship.

If I replace everything overnight/replace with an identical copy which is MY ship, then to Theseus it is theseus' ship, but only out of ignorance. For those who know, it is not.


> On board the ship was a sailor who really wanted his own ship but could not afford one. He came up with a plan: every time Theseus relpaced a wooden part for a metal one, he kept the wooden one and kept it. Eventually he had all the wooden parts, he re-assembled them into a ship again?
Q2: are there two ships of theseus? is this a problem?


Q3: aAll cells replaced every 7 years. Are you the same person?




If someone loses a leg, for example, they are not any less of a human or less of themselves. Perhaps then there is something more than the physical?
