# 07 Pinker :nauseated_face:

—by me

The “traditional conception of a ghost in the machine” is a popular description of Cartesian/substance dualism

- Mind and body are two substances with a real distinction
  - Substance is something which doesn’t require another creature to exist, only the will of God. e.g. “the rock is round”: “round” can only exist because of the “rock”, it cannot exist by itself (it requires another creature); “rock” can exist all by itself without requiring a creature to (if God willed it so)
  - “Real distinction” is when two substances *could* exist all by themselves without, including each other
- Mind and body still causally interact, the mind makes decisions and behaviour, but can exist independent of each other. Descartes views the mind and soul as one, we are just the mind and can therefore exist after the decay of the body independent of it. A body without the mind is lifeless, Descartes considers this to be anything from inanimate objects to plants and to animals (essentially anything non-human)
- The image of a ghost in a machine comes from this, the mind (soul) is like a ghost inside a machine (our bodies), determining our behaviour and being separate from it in substance, but still interacting with and being of it even though it would be possible for the two to be separate

Behaviour being caused by physical interactions refutes the “traditional view” that the mind causes and determines our behaviour and we are it, and leaves “no room for an uncaused behavior-chooser” as the mind is a separate substance in it. Therefore the idea that behaviour is chosen by the activity in our brain might not 

## 2 fears of determinism

Pinker identifies two main “fears” of determinism

### 1—Anxiety over free will & choice

Pinker claims that determinism can cause people to be anxious about their actions and choices, as they would not actually mean anything and not *be* choices. If everything has been predetermined by the state of our brains, then all the worrying over the right thing to do is pointless and a waste.

- Pinker suggests that the experience of choosing is not a fiction regardless of how the brain works
- It’s a “neural process, with the obvious functions of selecting behavior according to its foreseeable consequences”
- This process *is* you, Pinker states ~~without any argument as to why~~
- If the hardest form of determinism is true, then this anxiety would also be determined ~~which is really quite a meaningless point to make, “don’t be anxious about not being able to chose because your anxiety is determined so it is the real waste of time and not an issue”~~

### 2—Responsibility

Pinker assumes an incompatibalist perspective on free will and causal determinism

Pinker states that:

1. We blame people when they intended to do that act and could have chosen otherwise
2. We do not blame those who were not aware, could not foresee, or did not intend to do so
3. We do not blame those who are not in control of their actions

#### Biologies of human nature

Biology of human nature “would seem to admit more and more people into the ranks of the blameless”

- Because it might explain the behaviour of someone as not fully their control, people assume this means they are therefore not free to chose (so Pinker argues)
- Biology explaining behaviour is influenced by genetics pursuing an “ultimate rationale of our ancestors’ genes in the environment in which we evolved” makes punishing behaviour as silly as punishing a predator for eating its prey
- Evolutionary biology might suggest we are not fundamentally different to animals, molecular genetics and neuroscience might suggest we are not fundamentally different to inanimate matter. So it might be equally silly to punish humans as it would be to whip a church bell “for having assisted French heretics”

#### Failure of soul/mind saving responsibility

Pinker references Dennett.

If behaviour was chosen by an “utterly free will”, we could not hold people responsible for their actions

- That entity would not be deterred by anything as it could always defy the causes of behaviour.
- We could not “reduce evil acts” with moral or legal codes as that entity would be unaffected
- Punishment would be “sheer spite” as it would have no effect on future behaviour of that entity or others 

If this soul was affected by these causes, then it would no longer be “truly free”

- It would be “compelled (at least probabilistically) to respect those contingencies”
- Pinker thinks this renders the soul superfluous
  - This is only the case for the problem of free will, as the original purposes for Descartes’ dualism were to provide a source of possibility for external existence of the soul independent of the body in an afterlife and to separate mind-capacity from non-human things
  - As a counter point, freedom of choice must have some sort of effect, otherwise every action is just random with no effect and so there is no power over alternatives as there are no possibilities to begin with. This idea of an “absolute”/“utter” freedom is flawed. If there is no effect, then there is no freedom. Even if the soul is “compelled” to something, the only way for it not to be would be with no freedom, and it being compelled does not remove freedom.

#### Failure of probabilistic prediction saving responsibility

Pinker acknowledges that it is not deterministic in predetermining behaviour as it is probabilistic.

- Pinker argues this does not save responsibility or free will
- “There is *no* probability value that, by itself, ushers responsibility back”
  - The probability of something happening still means we have “nothing like free will”

Pinker mentions in passing Hume noticing the “dilemma inherent in equating the problem of moral responsibility with the problem of physical cause”

- Either our actions are determined
  - We are not responsible for them
- Or they are the result of random events
  - We are not responsible for them

#### Environmental determinism

Pinker notes that the most common excuse for bad behaviour using determinism is environmental determinism and behaviourism. So much so “that a genre of satire has grown around it”

The use of environmental factors in conditioning and influencing behaviour to the extent that we are not free to make decisions or be responsible for our actions

### The issue Pinker finds with this

“It is a confusion of *explanation* with *exculpation*. Contrary to what is implied…to explain behaviour is not to exonerate the behaver”

- If behaviour is not random, it will have some explanation
- If behaviour is random, it would have no explanation and we couldn’t hold the person responsible in any case

Therefore, if we were to hold someone responsible for their behaviour, it must be in spite of any causal explanation.

We must consider actions as freely chosen, even if there is an explanation as to the cause of them, unless that person is *literally* coerced.

This follows from the premise that environmental and biological explanations are probabilistic .

- If they were predetermined, then the person would have had no choice anyway.
  - The justification for punishment and blame and responsibility still applies to this however, as shall be explored later

## The purpose of Responsibility, punishment, and blame

Pinker argues that we do not need to solve the problem of determinism and free will; we only need to know what the aim of responsibility is

- Responsibility is a policy of deterrence using punishment and blame.

Punishment deters rational individuals from doing the action again or to begin with

- The *threat* of this punishment deters the behaviour, not the punishment itself
- This should be the case within a causally determined system and in one which is not

Therefore:

- We don’t apply punishment to those unaware of their actions or unperceptive to punishment because it would achieve nothing
- Predispositions to something are still punished because they simply explain part of the reason why someone did that action, but does not explain why they had to do it without a choice—it is still beneficial to deter the action.

There is a “paradox of deterrence”:

- “Though the threat of punishment can deter behavior, if the behavior does take place the punishment serves no purpose other than pure sadism or an illogical desire to make the threat credible retroactively”

- Only the extreme positions of no punishment or very harsh punishment can be defended
  - The intermediate position causes unnecessary harm to those deterred by less but not enough to deter those who require more
  - Too harsh punishment should deter all
  - No punishment as it is costly to the punisher, does harm to the punished, and has no immediate good or is useful to deter as the action has already happened
