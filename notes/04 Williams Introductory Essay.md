# 04 Williams Introductory Essay
Treat the *Meditations* as an exercise in thinking, a series of exercises, not as a book.
Read it as if you know nothing before and attempt the exercise of the *Meditations*.

"Its end lies in its beginning"

The issue of the Cartesian Circle

## Rationalism
Descartes holds:
- some things are known intuitively: intuition/deduction thesis
- some concepts you use in reason which are innate: the innate concept thesis

### Intuition/Deduction Thesis:
> The senses, although they are necessary for all our actual knowledge, are not sufficient to give us the whole of it, since our senses never give us anything but instances, that is to say particular or individual truths

Leibniz

In many areas our knowledge is greater than the sum of our experience--maths, metaphysics, morality. Knowledge must therefore come from:
- intuition (not simply a guess)
- deduction--premises building into bigger ideas/conclusions
### Innate knowledge thesis
Humans possess *a priori* knowledge as part of our rational nature
Plato's *Meno* might, in truth, prove the intuition/deduction thesis and not innate knowledge (leading questions)

Reflex reactions
Mind/Body distinction

### Innate Concept thesis
we have certain ideas within our rational nature and sense perception triggers a process to come to understand them.

> On the contrary, I clearly understand that there is no more reality in an infinite substance than in finite one, and hence my perception of the infinite, that is God, is in some way prior to my perception of the finite, that is myself.

Meditation 1 + 2 destroy everything down to what can be known

Med 3-6 then build everything back up that is knowledge, by rationalism.
