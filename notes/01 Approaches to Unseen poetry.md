# 01 Approaches to Unseen poetry
My approach, flexible (not prescriptive):
1. Title, try and get an image of what it could be
2. If given poet name/date, look for context & how it could influence the poetry (but depends on markscheme, don't do for IB)
3. Read the poem, writing reactions and ideas it raises in the margin.
4. Try and find some general meaning/purpose, how it links to some theme/a theme it relates to etc/ a subject of the poem. (get an intuitive feel of the poem)
5. Begin the analysis, I usually start with structure, then key imagery/illusions, poetic voice/narrator, sound and rhythm.
6. Consider how the techniques used inform the intuition of the subject/ SERVE the purpose of the poet, try not to force an interpretation which doesn't work: find an interpretation which doesn't force techniques and the poem into it, but rather one which the poem raises.
7. Start writing!

Reading poetry for pleasure or for academic purposes is similar in that one should not try to quantify or mechanically analyse the poem.
