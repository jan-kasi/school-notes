# 18 Doubting "I exist"
'Weeeell, there is no therefore and you don;t need to know what thinking is to know that you exist'
However, underneath all this is an assumption that you exist.

- Not proving that you don't exist
- All you need to do is show that the idea that you exist is potentially doubtable to disprove Descartes

## Personal identity
What makes a person identical to themselves?

When Descartes makes the claim "I am a thinking thing"/ "I exist", he is speaking of the immaterial mind. The cogito is within mind and has nothing to do about body.

The cogito is a purely mental state of self-verification, nothing to do with the body or reliant on body.


In order to doubt our existence we must call into doubt our mind and our body.

For Descartes, identity resides purely in the immaterial.
- If you can prove that any part of identity resides in some way in the material/body, then you can call into doubt that you exist.

## Hume
Epistemology, ideas and impressions, copy theory
The mind is a bundle of ideas and impressions
Hume is an empiricist
Identity is made purely of sense perceptions
If your identity is made of ideas and impressions and imaginations etc, then it is reliant on sense perceptions, so on the body.
- The mind may then very well be immaterial, but it is reliant on the body to have identity/your identity is dependent on the body. This means it can be doubted and that identity is dependant on body.
- Therefore when Descartes says "I think", he makes an assumption that he has an immaterial mind in which identity purely 
resides.
  - Your identity could be entirely shaped by other people
  - Links to Bentham and James Mill: took JS Mill and made him.

If all of your existence is sense perceptions, they can be manipulated and doubted.
Sensation -> belief
Sensation -> I think

AND
Sensation -> I exist
"You" don't exist, you just wrongly induced that a lucky collection of a few molecules must mean that this is autonomous existence and you are it.



This is weak.
