# 17 Problems of Evil

1. The logical problem of evil?
Inconsistent triad: it is a logical innconsistency to claim God is all loving and all powerful and evil&suffering exist. Deductive argument. (modernised by J.L mackie)

2. The evidential problem of evil?
Existence of unnecesary exessive evil provides some evidence against God's existence. It inductively supports the premise that God does not exist. (William Rowe)

3. Differences?
Evidential does not claim there is a logical contradiction betweeen the three premises, while Logical does. In this regard, perhaps it is stronger. A defence of why they are compatible fails on the evidential one, as it is conceptually possible for it to not have been this way, therefore the likelihood of God's existence is lower. Evidential is inductive, logical is deductive. 

4. Similarities?
Both are arguments against the existence of God. Both use the existence of evil as a premise, both deal with love and power of God. Both a posteriori.


## Logical problem of Rvil
1. God is all powerfull
2. God is all knowing
3. Evil exists

Deductive, a posteriori knowledge.
We have evidence that evil exists, then either God can only be 1 or 2, not both.

P1: Def of God
P2: Evil exists
P3: [Contradictions], evil does exist, contradicting God
P4: No God


Deductive: The premises lead necessarily to the conclusion [if one holds all premises to be true]

## Evidential problem of Evil
- presense of unnecessary evil inductively supports the claim that God does not exist
- there exist instances of intense suffering which an all knowing and loving being could have prevented without  thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.
- therefore there does not exist and omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good being.

Inductive: repeat observations of exessive & unnecessary evil
C: Probably no God.

uses a value judgement of "excessive" evil, and this may differ between people.



## Strengths
|Logical|Evidential|
|-|-|
|Deductive (theoretically strogner)||
|Absolute conclusion (does not actually make it stronger, these are very dangerous)|Appreicates pragmatism, requires more countering to disprove|
||Witness excessive evil|
||Does not have to make claims which label things as being something and knowing what they are. It simply makes a claim about ex essiveness|
||Augustine doesn't apply to this (there is no such thing as evil, there are only different levels of good), Rawe could rephrase this in an Augustinian way: there are things in this world which are excessively not good, and it serves no purpose they could just be more good|

I argue that the Evidential problem is stronger


## Logical v Evidential
|Logical|Evidential|
|-|-|
|attacks God's benevolence and omnipotence|omnipotence, benevolence AND omniscient|
|Based on traditional notion of God accepted by Christians, not favoured by atheists|focuses on a posteriori knowledge of the world--existence of evil|
|not based on a value judgement of what consitutes evil|you cannot defeat the evidential problem by making a Consistent Triad. Instead, Christians must show why it is more plausible or possible that evil can be explained by God, or why things are the way they are|
|uses atheist terms sometimes, can be disputed by redefining with Christian terms|can be redefined with Christian terms and still applies, does not make any claims about the nature of things: it applies regardless|
