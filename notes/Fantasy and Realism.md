# Fantasy and Realism
- Literary realism attempts to represent familiar things as they are. Realist authors chose to depict everyday and banal activities and experiences.

- Plot and characters are assessed on how believable they are, attempts to represent subject matter truthfully without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions.

- Jules Francois Champfleury--- realist literature attempts to reproduce "objective reality", showing everyday, mundane elements of life

- Realism developed partly as a reaction to the "excesses" of Romanticism and the Gothic

Features of Realist literature:
- Believable, plausible plot (links to horror vs terror in the Gothic)
- Objective narrative (or one with the illusion of objectivity!)
- "Social realism"---presenting an unflinching view of the lives of ordinary people to draw attention to their conditions
- Depicts everyday quotidian events
- Reality is knowable (exists outside of humans' conceptual schemas, narratives and subjective consciousnesses)
- Rational---reason, empiricism, objective observation prioritised over abstract emotion and Romanticism

Wuthering heights drifts into the fantastical, still plausible but not common in the way it is portrayed
Lots of unrestrained emotion and melodrama, heightened drama and Romanticist excesses the major driving force throughout the novel.
Unreality and character choices prioritised
