# 01 Intro and William Alston's Ordinary Language

## How can we meaningfully talk about God?

"God is love"

### Metaphysical background: realism vs. anti-realism

|Realist|Anti-Realist|
|-|-|
|There is an external and independent (but not isolated) reality. Truth simply requires correspondence to this reality|There is no such accessible reality. Truth simply requires correspondence to the something mind-dependent|



### The problem

| Cognitive Language           | Non-cognitive language                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Expresses fact and knowledge | Expresses things which we could never know, feelings, values, and perhaps metaphysical claims |

Critics of religion might emphasise the Non-Cognitive nature of much religious language.

The apologist may respond that this has no issue, or claim that there are some cognitive aspects in religion.



What is the assumption being made if we accept that there is a problem with religious language?

- That ordinary language is not capable of talking meaningfully about religion



### William Alston

**Univocal**: has one meaning only, the same meaning in all situations.

**Univocal language**: The term, regardless of who it relates to, signifies only one thought/points to only one thing.

For religious language, this could mean that when we say “God is good” we have exactly the same meaning of “goodness” as when we say “This cat is good”.

Thinkers might quickly reject univocal language:

- we are physically limited beings, whereas God is not. Therefore descriptions of us cannot apply to God
- God is transcendent—we cannot understand God, therefore we can never know what God is

Assumption made: ordinary language cannot talk meaningfully about reigious concepts because it is not possibl ehtat religious terms point to the same thing as their ordinary language equivalent.

Alston challenges this assumption, he advocated for partially univocal language. We can partially univocally talk about God with ordinary language.

- We are physically limited being, whereas God is not
- However, two different things can possess the same feature but in different ways

Example:

> A new computer and a new acquaintance can both be “intriguing” in a single sense of the term, even though what makes one intriguing is very different from what makes the other intriguing

—Alston, Divine Nature and Human Language: Essays in Philosophical Theology

- both produce “intrigue” even if the method or nature is different



A human being can “know” a fact and God can also “know” the same fact, but

> how God knows something or the way that God knows something will be different from the way that a human being knows something insofar as God is incorporeal, omniscient, and so forth. According to Alston, the difference in the way knowledge is acquired doesn’t prevent us from saying that the psychological concept, “knows p”, can still be applied to both human beings and to God.

They yield the same result.



Mental process need not be defined by their structure, but by their consequence. He was a functionalist in this respect.

[Functionalism: The notion that mental states can be fully/sufficiently defined by their consequences/functions—their effects in the World]

God and human beings perform the same functions—they can both “know” or “recognise the best of X”. Therefore if we understand what a human I is doing, we can partially understand what God is doing.

PARTIALLY because:

- the concepts are the same, but do not work exactly the same due to the nature of God

- it only applies to certain things, in Alston’s case it only applies when we are using **functions**

criticisms:

- knowledge of God and transcendence
- simplicity: we cannot know about God if God is simple

BUT:

- assumptions of knowledge:
  - that transcendence means we cannot know **anything**
  - that knowledge must be absolutely certain
  - that knowing the function means we know the nature
    - counter point: does Alston make this claim? No. Indeed, perhaps posing this question is misunderstannding Alston...
