# 16 Ontological
## Norman Malcom

- If God doesn't exist, God cannot come into existence
  - This would require a cause and make God a limited being
- If God already exists, God cannot cease to exist
i.e. if you accept the *nature* of the Judeo-Christian God (in this instance, eternal and uncausable/always was and always will be)

1. God necessarily exists
  1. This is impossible (this is not the case as there is no contradiction)
  2. It is probable (since God is *necessary*, this cannot be true. It either IS, or IS NOT)
      - statements about God can never be probable
  3. It is true (this is the only alternative left, and must therefore be the case)
2. Therefore, [1] can be held to be true

Malcom accepts this only applies if accepting the nature of the Judeo-Christian God

Malcom thinks that the Ontological argument ONLY proves that:
1. God has always existed, does exist, and always will exist
  OR
2. God has never existed, doesn't exist, and never will

THEREFORE, Malcom's argument follows from this:
- Taking the ontological argument as meaning that it's impossible for God to exist, or God does exist
- Which one is true

Malcom accepts that the conclusion "God exists is necessary" is NOT analytical, OA proves there are 2 possibilities left (3, but not contingent so therefore only 2)



BUT:
it should not be "true, probable, impossible" it should be "true, probable, (possible), (impossible), false, "
It riggs the dice. The seeming trichotomy is wrong. DENY THE TRICHOTOMY, it is a false trichotomy.
