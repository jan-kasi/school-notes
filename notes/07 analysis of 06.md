# 07 analysis of 06
note:
If God is necessary, does that mean God can't be falsified? This might make arguments which claim God *has* to exist meaningless.
## Flew
Perhaps a category mistake
Perhaps transcendence is a necessary part of God. This is a bad point:
- transcendence isn't *part* of God, it is a human limitation
- isn't this the very issue? that it makes God meaningless.

Flew goes too far and misunderstands what religious language is: the other points, e.g. Hare or Mitchell

## Hare
bliks are unfalsifiable.
Positivists and falsifification theorists could be said to be bliks in themselves?

Sane and insane bliks. How can we know which is which?

Hare claims that belief in God is a sane blik.

Bliks place too much distance between belief and reality. Religious people should not be willing to accept their beliefs as bliks because they believe their faith corresponds to reality.
Religious language claims are not like this, they do not claim interpretation but reality.

The blik is the individual expression of the religious.

Individual beliefs of God expressing the religious through religious language are equally valid and coherent to the individual.

Anti-realist view of truth. Doesn't this go against the claims of religion.

Criticism of internal contradiction of insane and sane bliks:
- Counter:
- Hare does not claim that a blik is absolute truth, it is about truth to the individual
- An insane blik is still true to the individual, as is a sane blik
- The distinction is of it is a reasonable position which can hold itself
- If a blik is insane it is unreasonable and does not hold to anyone, even the individual, yet they continue to believe it. This is what makes it insane, it is not about if it is true or false to the individual or external, inaccesible, reality

## Mitchell
