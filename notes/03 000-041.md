Leaves


## Miss Kilman

## Septimus
- neglect of mental health
- search for quick cure and appearance of normality instead of treatment
- shallowness of medical intervention, e.g. cricket image repeated
  - ignoring problem and forcing normality, kind of like "fake it 'till you make it"
- marriage of Septimus and Rezia
  - desire to help, but considers this as pushing Septimus to force normality
  - isolation, "left Italy for his sake"
  - negatively affect each other
- withdrawn into self
  - like Mrs D "outside, looking in"
- alienation?
- Metaphor for post-war Europe, something they are just trying to sweep under the rug (the people who returned and the damage of the war)
- p20 Rzia's perception "everything terrible", "robbed of colour"
  - alienation from English society
  - contrast with Mrs D's perception of the same stimuli
- Rezia, long sentences, fluid, emotional syntax
- Septimus, short, staccato, fragmented sentences
- Septimus' connection with nature


- phenomenology link

## Images
Aeroplane
- military technology, used for air raids and used for advertising, risk of threat
- another image which unites characters, e.g. the chimes of Big Ben, universalises the theme
- technology and its effects of people
Rose
- English, traditional heraldic motif
Silver/Metal/Crystal
- material, class/wealth
Peter's knife
- potential for violence (of empire, war, Europe, self)
- Used as a distraction
- Psychological distraction
- Constancy, lack of change
