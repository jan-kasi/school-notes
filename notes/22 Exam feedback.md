# 22 Exam feedback

Answer the question directly.

Part (a) plan:
Don't need the waves of doubt.

1. Start with the Deceiver: Descartes' concept of the cogito is an attempt to find indubitable knowledge even in the face of "a deceiver of supreme power and cunning". This deceiver cannot "bring it about that I am nothing so long as I think that I am something".
  - Descartes' attempt to find certain knowledge which cannot be doubted relies on surviving this hypothetical scenario where it at first appears one cannot know anything
  - Method which Descartes' uses to find indubitable knowledge, and leads on from meditation 1
  - Internal knowledge, not external
  - Skepticism, extreme rejection of external, turning inwards.
  - Possibility that there is something the possibility of the deceiver cannot bring doubt to
2. Therefore one is a thing which thinks
- What is this thing which is something? "A thing that thinks"
- Realisation that what a rational animal is does not matter, the content can be doubted but the act of thinking cannot
- So one is, "strictly, a thing that thinks"
- This seems to be the only thing which cannot be doubted, that one is a thing that is thinking, a res cogitans
3. One cannot doubt "I am, I exist"
- Explain the I am, the comma (connection), the I exist
4. Not logical necessity 
- "is necessarily true, every time I express it or conceive of it in my mind"
- Nature of the cogito, it is a self verifying statement

Part (b) plan:

1. A thing that thinks: can I really say that I am thinking?
2. I am, I exist: Can I say that I exist?
3. Necessarily true: Nature of the cogito, is this necessarily true? Questioning the connection.
