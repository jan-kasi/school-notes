# 01 Intro
1958- Things Fall Apart

1962 - important year in history of modern African Countries, end of explicit colonialism, gaining independence from collapse of British Empire

Achebe doesn't wash away the disturbing things or sentimentalise the native African culture
- shows the moral complexity of situations and people, not just good and bad people

Things fall apart: set in 1890s, the first forays of the British into Nigeria and creeping colonialism
Arrow of God: set in 1920s, British colonial rule has been firmly established
No longer at ease: modern day Nigeria set in post-liberation stage, corruption 

How can you use the colonial language to express the anti-colonialist and African perspective.
- Linguistic colonialism

The history of Africa taught as being a blank and then filled in by British colonialists, where there were really full civilisations and histories which are destroyed. Not something which was "discovered".
