# 48 Q꞉ Method for Establishing Certainty
a. Explain Descartes' method of establishing certainty.
b. To what extent does Descartes' method of establishing certainty succeed?

A.
Introduction has definition of Cartesian Certainty

1. Descartes' waves of Sensory doubt and Dream argument
- Descartes' method involves using doubt to discredit empiricism, the senses can not be trusted to give accurate information, or even be trusted to be giving information about reality/experiencing reality at all.
2. Descartes' Painter's Analogy, into Origins and Deceiver
- Nonetheless, there are some things fundamental which must exist in some way for the senses to provide information. These are not discovered through the senses, but despite the senses. For example mathematical concepts and the reasoning of something having to be behind these faulty non-reality sensate impressions.
- However, there is no guarantee that we are not being deceived of these things due to our senses. The senses are even more unreliable as we may be made to go wrong, or even have a defective origin, which means we cannot be certain of anything the senses give even without the senses themselves deceiving or if we are unaware of our nature.
3. Having established the place of rationalism and the rejection of empiricism, Deceiver as hyperbolic extension of doubt not just to that which can be doubted for a reason, but if everything is doubted. To attempt to find something certain, something which cannot be doubted. Arrival at cogito and definition of cogito.

B.

1. The certainty established is not actual certainty (critique the cogito).
  - Critique the certainty that the cogito tries to achieve (Cogito scholars reading sheet may be useful), rather than the entire nature one by one of the individual parts.
2. The method of doubt is not able to establish certainty.
  1. It does not find certainty or generate it, it simply looks for that known in some other way (in the case of the cogito, for Descartes it is known by itself anyway regardless of method)
  2. Doubt is artificially limited, making it nonsense
  3. Because otherwise it is self-defeating, so removing the artificial limits results in nothing, the method is incapable of establishing certainty.
3. Regardless of these inherent flaws, the waves Descartes' purports to use are not very good.
  - You can attack individual waves or the groupings.
