# 07 Teresa of Ávila
[Descartes' debt to Teresa of Ávila](https://philpapers.org/archive/MERDDT.PDF)

## 6

Both D and T offer an opportunity to go from false knowledge to certain knowledge.
- T is provoked by normative beliefs, "Public honour is valuable", "It is sensible to attend to one's possessions".
- D is provoked by descriptive claims, "I am sitting in front of a fire", "2+3=5"

### Step 1
> The meditator recognises that many of her past and current beliefs need to be reevaluated.

- Teresa describes how easy it is to be deceived into believing falsehoods, and how this ends in states of unhappiness, ending in hope of convincing the reader to reevaluate their past and current beliefs
- Descartes summarises this in the beginning of M1
### Step 2
 > The meditator sees the need to set aside current beliefs as a first step in the discovery of fundamental truths.

- Teresa uses a biblical example to describe how not rejecting these beliefs and gaining true knowledge will lead her readers to no spiritual growth
- Descartes uses a metaphor for the necessity of this, demolishing everything and starting at the foundations, and offers an escape from epistemological uncertainty to certainty about fundamental truth
### Step 3
 > The only proper way to begin anew and attain secure knowledge of fundamental truths is for the meditator to refrain from assenting to present and former beliefs about the external world

 - Teresa attempts to justify why the reader must reject assenting to these beliefs by showing their uncertainty and how not doing so will lead to no spiritual progress
 - Descartes agrees, though it is not as explicit:
  > "So in future I
 must withhold my assent from these former beliefs just as carefully as I would from
 obvious falsehoods, if I want any certainty"

### Step 4
> Immediately after the meditator commits to withholding assent from her former beliefs, those beliefs return so that she is tempted to recommit

- Teresa describes these as "poisonous vermin", the beliefs absorb and entice her to re-embrace the beliefs, serving as a barrier to the meditator
- Descartes too writes how it seems simpler to simply believe these than keep doubting
### Step 5
> A deceiving demon further confounds the meditator and stops her progress

- The meditative progress is halted by demons which attempt to make these beliefs seem eternal and enticing, it is almost impossible to no believe these
- Descartes deviates with a twist: the evil deceiver is a mere possibility, a hypothesis
  - This cleverly avoids any commitment to demonic powers
  - This hypothetical power causes the meditator to be unable to proceed in knowledge
### Step 6
> The meditator sees the need to rethink her way forward, which requires self-
 exploration

 - Teresa sees that she is unable to sever her ties to former beliefs, though she sees the world is filled with falsehood. This means we must examine ourselves and recognise our present incapacity to avoid error.
  - The only way forward is to strengthen her will in accordance to God's
  > "Well now, it is foolish to think that we will enter heaven without entering into ourselves, coming to know ourselves" (II: 1, 11 (303)).

- While Descartes' demon is hypothetical, it causes the same epistemological problem, and the meditator must find a new plan
  - Like Teresa this leads to concerning the will, but he decides to "turn my will in completely the opposite direction and deceive myself by pretending for a time that these former opinions are utterly false"
  - In meditation 2, when Descartes is in a "whirlpool" of confusion, he discovers he is "a thinking thing", a discovery of the self



### The Journey
Both Descartes and Teresa lead the meditator to a series of steps at the end of which they begin to think of self exploration, and thus begin understanding more things


- Might the Cartesian Circle and cogito look different in the concept of Teresa's proposals?
