# ch 19–21 questions

## Chapter 19 
“My friend, you see how perishable are the riches of this world; nothing is certain but virtue” (p. 51) To what extent is this shown to be true in the novel? 

- Transience and impermanence of worldly, material goods, e.g. Cunegonde and the old woman’s jewellery stolen  
- Dutch pirate’s theft of Candide’s riches  
- Candide’s focus on Cunegonde over material goods (e.g. sacrifice of great riches in Eldorado) 
- Candide’s virtue/values in tact despite poverty 
- Love as a moral or material trait? 

Read the slave’s account of his life on p. 51-2. How does Voltaire present slavery and which institutions does he satirise in doing so? 

- Humanisation of the slave through his eloquent, first person narrative in order to demonstrate the intelligence and ability of the slave and rebut beliefs in racial inferiority 
- Suggests all people are created equal (a key Enlightenment value, e.g. liberte, egalite, fraternite) 
- Challenges Christian justifications for slavery by showing the moral character of the slave, suggesting they do not need ‘saving’ 
- Self-destruction, contradictions, hypocrisy 
- Fetish = an object to be worshipped 

How does Candide’s moral outlook change in this chapter? 

- Moves away from Pangloss’s optimism after seeing more of the world and hearing the slave’s narrative 
- The belief in optimism is only possible in Eldorado (a mythical, non-existent world) suggesting its lack of application in the real world 
- Loss of all worldly treasures through the pirate 
- Loss of innocence 

## Chapter 20 

Martin describes himself as a “Manichean”. What does he mean by this and to what extent is his viewpoint supported by the action of the novel so far? 

- Manichean = good and evil are equal and opposing forces 
- Mirrored by the structure of the novel, where good and evil come alternately and replace each other throughout 
- Evil comes to destroy good fortune, e.g. wealth/power 
- No ‘order’ or reason to good or bad events 

How are Candide and Martin’s views different? Which, if either, does Voltaire suggest we should agree with? 

- Candide still focused on Pangloss’s optimistic philosophy, though beginning to move away from it	 
- Lack of belief in reason, moral order, or justification for evil in Martin’s views 
- The universe is neither governed by good or bad 
- Structure of the novel suggests the loss of hope in characters and the reader – every time a good occurrence is seen, it is thwarted or undermined. Reader begins to be more pessimistic/sceptical of a clear moral or narrative resolution. 

What could Cunegonde be being used to represent at the end of the chapter? 

- Shows that Candide’s conversations with Martin have not eroded his sense of optimism, as he maintains his hope in finding her 
- Cunegonde as a concept/idea representing his belief in optimism 
- Cunegonde represents how the belief system one holds is largely dependant on circumstance

## Chapter 21 

How does Voltaire present his home country of France? 

- Presents opposing views of Candide and Martin 
- Candide suggests the cultural significance of France, reflecting views of the optimism of Europe 
- Martin gives an outsider’s view, emphasising the injustice and shallowness of France and its imperfections 
- What could be suggested by Martin's lack of interest or surprise in the accounts of Candide’s adventures? 
- Desensitised as he has seen so many “extraordinary” things 
- Believes that the world is strange and peculiar, as well as immoral and corrupt 

How does Martin seem to answer the problem of evil? 

- Evil has always existed and is a part of human nature – “always have the same nature” 
- Evil is a part of human nature that we need to accept, not something that we should attempt to philosophise away 
- Nihilism – lack of clear meaning or purpose 
- Empiricism, a posteriori (philosophy comes after experience)
