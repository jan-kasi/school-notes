# II ch 01
Initially establish the unreliability of Nelly, what causes Lockwood to call her a "fair" narrator, simply that she tells a good story?

White dress is a reference to the ghost of Catherine which Lockwood thinks he sees.

Many elements of the Gothic in Catherine's descriptions
Frailty of the flesh
Madness
The mortal body

Catherine's anger and grief

"as mad as yourself"---Catherine driven to madness, or at least perceived as


Very :sparkles: ***dramatic*** :sparkles: reunion

Catherine's idea of heaven, neither TG or WH

Depersonalisation and entrapment
Narcissistic personality
obsessive compulsions?
Dissociation from body perhaps, but it wasn't really a studied thing and doesn't really seem like what she is describing, she more seems trapped inside and tired of life instead of dissociated.
More imprisonment in TG, marriage, society, and health/life

Narcissistic and harmful love

Nelly portrays Catherine as almost evil
Suggests she needs to get rid of her person as well as body to get into heaven

Social tragedy

Links to Romeo and Juliet? Perhaps a corrupted love of the stars, or one of circumstance instead of written in the stars. But different as R\&J are forced apart, and C\&H together.

Nelly is more horrified by the passionate and deviant sexuality than an objective narrator might have as she is so conventional.

Heathcliff and Catherine both constantly guilt trip each other

## How do Catherine and Heathcliff feel out each other?
Aggrieved and passionate.
They both feel abandoned by each other
Is their hatred genuine?
They are both selfishly obsessed with each other
Toxic, they do not care if they're happy

Heathcliff seems conflicted, though how genuine this is is questionable.

External and internal conflict.

## What type of love is it?
Narcissistic love which they feel is "necessary"
Idea of being literal soulmate
Religious ecstasy

Subversion of Gothic, wants to be haunted.
Says it doesn't matter if they are happy, she can be dead but she needs to be there---selfish
