# 06 Theology and Falsification: A Symposium
Antony Flew, R. M. Hare, and Basil Mitchell had a famous discussion about falsification theory in 1955 in an article the heading is titled after.

## Flew and the Gardener

Two people: the believer and the sceptic.

The thing in question: a garderner.

1st, there is a gardener. But when they cannot find them, the believer claims the gardener is invisible. When bloodhounds do not sense the gardener, the believer claims they are also scentless and give no sound.

The sceptic asks how a so-called “invisible, intangible, elusive gardner differs from an imaginary gardener, or even no gardener at all.”

Regardless of evidence in support or to the contrary, people continue to believe or disbelieve in God. 

This means faith is unfalsifiable since no evidence is able to definitively prove the status of God’s existence.

God dies “a death by a thousand qualifications”, believers modify their statements about God when challenged that they no longer resembke the original claim.

Religious language is therefore meaningless as it is unfalsifiable and changeable at a whim.

### John Wisdom

Flew’s parable is inspired by John Wisdom. However, Wisdom makes the opposite claim with the same story:

- Both the believer and sceptic make reasonable statements—they view the same thing and make reasonable statements supported but not verified by the known facts
- Because we can’t verify either statement, this just means the debate is outside the scope of scientific enquiry
- The test for the meaningfulness of religious statements and scientific statements is not the same

## Hare and the lunatic

Bliks:

> A certain lunatic is convinced that all University tutors want to murder
> him. His friends introduce him to all the mildest and most respectable
> dons that they can find, and after each of them has retired, they say,
> ‘You see, he doesn’t really want to murder you; he spoke to you in a
> most cordial manner; surely you are convinced now?’ But the lunatic
> replies, ‘Yes, but that was only his diabolical cunning; he’s really
> plotting against me the whole time, like the rest of them; I know it, I
> tell you.’ However many kindly dons are produced, the reaction is still
> the same.

A blik is the way in which a person sees and interpret the world. Bliks are not falsifiable and don’t make testable claimes. It is simply how an individuals sees the world around them.

- Religious language claims are an example of bliks
- They are how an individual interprets the world, they are not falsifiable

Religious language claims being bliks might not undermine their value

- Hare thinks it matters wether your blik is sane or insane
- He comment’s on flew’s analogy by stating that it is because he cares about what goes in on the garden that he is unable to share the sceptic’s detatchment
- We cannot decide which blik is best by observing the world

However, how can we determine if belief in God, or more specifically belief in a particular religion, is an insane or sane blik (if we cannot determine better bliks by observing the world).

Flew responds that religious people should not be happy to accept their beliefs as bliks bevause they claim their beliefs correspond to some absolute, external, and true, reality—not just their interpretation of the world. Chrisitianity, for example, os clear about making assertions about the real world, such as God creating the universe.

## Mitchell and the Stranger

> In time of war in an occupied country, a member of the resistance meets one night a
> stranger who deeply impresses him. They spend that night together in conversation.
> The Stranger tells the partisan that he himself is on the side of the resistance – indeed
> that he is in command of it, and urges the partisan to have faith in him no matter what
> happens. The partisan is utterly convinced at that meeting of the Stranger’s sincerity
> and constancy and undertakes to trust him.
> They never meet in conditions of intimacy again. But sometimes the Stranger is seen
> helping members of the resistance, and the partisan is grateful and says to his friends,
> ‘He is on our side.’
> Sometimes he is seen in the uniform of the police handling over patriots to the
> occupying power. On these occasions his friends murmur against him: but the partisan
> still says, ‘He is on our side.’ He still believes that, in spite of appearances, the Stranger
> did not deceive him. Sometimes he asks the Stranger for help and receives it. He is
> then thankful. Sometimes he asks and does not receive it. Then he says, ‘The Stranger
> knows best.’ Sometimes his friends, in exasperation, say, ‘Well, what would he have to
> do for you to admit that you were wrong and that he is not on our side?’ But the
> partisan refuses to answer. He will not consent to put the Stranger to the test. And
> sometimes his friends complain, ‘Well, if that’s what you mean by his being on our
> side, the sooner he goes over to the other side the better.’

Believers will accept evidence which appears to contradict their beliefs, e.g. the problem of evil (perhaps some, at least).

But they will refuse to doubt their beliefs because they’re commited believers

Their belief comes fom having assessed the evidence and as such an assesment will never reach a certain conclusion.

They simply weigh the options and evidence.

“It is important that faith is not just vacuous formulae (expressing, perhaps, a desire for reassurance) to which expirience makes no difference and which makes no difference to life.”

Falsification misses the point of religious statements.

Flew responds that in the end, the believer will have to avoid the action of qualifications, which would constitute a failure in faith as well as in logic

Furthermore, is it really accepting evidence if it changes nothing about your beliefs? To me this seems a little like saying.

## Swinburne

- Factual statements can be falsified but existential ones can’t be
- This doesn’t stop existential statements being meaningful
- Example of something like toy stroy where the toys play but when no one can see them. This is ficticious and unverifiable but still meaningful.
  - Or is it? What does it mean for something to be meaningful. If it cannot affect us in any way, is it really “meaningful” to us? (This changes the idea of what meaningfulness is slightly from the positivist view and Swinburne’s)
- Swinburne rejects both Popper’s and Flew’s definition of meaningfulness
