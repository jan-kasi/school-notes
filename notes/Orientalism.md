# Orientalism
Edward W. Said
## Introduction
### I

> "The Orient was almost a European invention...Now it was disappearing"

Interesting to note that the ideas one cultural group has of an other are almost always fictitious, and Id initially notice that this is often both the case for dominator and dominated. However, perhaps the dominator manages to enforce their myth more effectively, the subjugated culture is turned towards becoming seen as it and become it, whereas the subjugated maintains it as a myth in the common culture.

European and American ideas of the Orient are different due to the difference in historical involvement and European tradition of *Orientalism*: "a way of coming to terms with the Orient that is based on the Orient's special place in European Western experience"

The Orient:
- held some of Europe's oldest colonies
- is its cultural rival
- the source of many Occidental languages
- is one of the deepest and most common images Europe has of the Other.

Foucault's notion of the *discourse* (*Archaeology of Knowledge* and *Discipline and Punish*) relevant to identify Orientalism as. It is "a Western style for dominating, restructuring, and having authority over the Orient"
### II
The Orient is an idea made by humans, it is not an inert fact of nature, as are all history and geography. Applying Visco's observation that "men make their own history" to geography as geographical issues and cultural entities such as Occident and Orient are man-made.

However, the Orient is not *essentially* an idea with no correspondence to reality. It is a brute fact that it is about real people and real culture.

The ideas, histories and cultures cannot be seriously understood without their force and configurations of power.
Relationship between Orient and Occident is a relationship of power, domination, and complex hegemony.

### III
Three aspects of Said's reality which informed the investigation. I found the first the most interesting:
1. The distinction between pure and political knowledge
    - Some knowledge seems to have no political impact or implication, in the everyday sense of the word
    - For some, their ideological colour is a matter of incidental importance to policy and politics, whereas for others it is directly interwoven
    - For some, it is incidentally present in their thought/produced work, for others it is intentionally so
    - However, no production of knowledge can be wholly non-political or ignore the political and individual circumstances of the individual and of where it was produced.
    - One European or Americana comes up against the Orient as the European/American first, and as an individual second
    - This is not an inert fact, it holds implications 
    - Saturating hegemonic systems (like culture) have internal constraints upon thinkers which were productive
    - Philosophy keeps itself "pure" by removing the purpose/political implications of its' thinkers' ideas, e.g. Empiricism as a defence for slavery, etc.

The second was also interesting:

2. The methological question
    - Unlike Foucault, Said believes the individual writer/contributor can have a significant impact.
    - Said is "indebted" to Foucault's work, however

## 1: The Scope of Orientalism
### I, Knowing the Oriental

39
> Cromer makes no effort to conceal that Orientals for him were always and only the human material he governed in British colonies

> To say simply that Orientalism was a rationalization of colonial rule is to ignore the extent to which colonial rule was justified in advance by Orientalism

40
> Knowledge of the Orient, because generated out of strength, in a sense *creates* the Orient, the Oriental, and his world

Orientalism as an exercise in cultural strength.

47
> Kissinger may not have known on what fund the of pedigreed knowledge he was drawing on when he cut the world into pre-Newtonian and post-Newtonian conceptions of reality. But his distinction is identical with the orthodox one made by Orientalists, who separate Orientals from Westerners. And like Orientalism's distinction Kissinger's is not value-free, despite the apparent neutrality of his tone

### II, Imaginative Geography and Its Representations: *Orientalizing the Oriental*

50
> To speak of scholarly specialization as a geographical "field" is, in the case of Orientalism, fairly revealing since no one is likely to imagine a field symmetrical to it called Occidentalism. Already the special, perhaps even the eccentric attitude of Orientalism becomes apparent.

> accept enormous, indiscriminate size plus an almost infinite capacity for subdivision as one of the chief characteristic of Orientalismâ€”one that is evidenced in its confusing amalgam of imperial vagueness and precise detail
