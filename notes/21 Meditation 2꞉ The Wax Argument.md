# 21 Meditation 2: The Wax Argument

Descartes' argument
1. All the properties our senses perceive in the wax change when the wax is melted
2. So nothing that we sense is the same form when solid as when it is liquid
3. So it cannot be our senses which make us suppose it is the same

From what can I know that it is still the wax?

- Option 1 Imagination: Imagination is experience changed, it cannot give real knowledge ***
- Intellect + Judgement: A choice, “does this idea accurately reflect reality?”
  - Intellect is a Passive Vessel that receives sense-perceptions and ideas. Where they sit.
  - Judgement is the Will applied.

Sense perception does not give any truth of what the wax is.

- Sense perception =/=  Truth about reality

M2:

> Let us consider it attentively, and setting aside everything that does not belong to the wax, let us see what remains. Indeed nothing remains except something **extended**…

Extension

- Something exists in formal reality



| Representational reality                                     | Formal reality                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Reality as you perceive it, your perception of the world. Secondary qualities | Actual reality, the thing as it actually is (formally). Primary quality. |
| Secondary qualities                                          | Primary qualities                                            |
|                                                              |                                                              |



| Secondary qualities                                          | Primary quality                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Qualities which are really sense perceptions within us. Things we perceive as a result of interaction with the primary quality. | Qualities that something has independent of sense perception. Extension. What allows secondary qualities. |





Back to the wax.



secondary qualities –> intellect <– Will –> Judgement –> Primary quality —> secondary qualities



Box around primary quality. Dotted line between judgement & Pq, and between Pq & Sq. (inside is formal reality)



Inside Formal Reality, truth lies. If you can know what is inside formal reality, you can know what is right and wrong. This is very hard, until meditation 6.



Box around intellect, will and judgement. This box is the mind.



Between judgement and Pq, a question: to what extent is judgement about Pq correct?

For D, the arrow goes into Formal reality, and stops before the dotted line. You cannot pierce the veil except for a select few areas. e.g. the positivists (such as Ayer) are stuck in representational reality



In the box of mind, there are the innate concepts, which weave into Will and into Judgements.



Innate concepts are proof of God as they are originating from Formal Reality as gifts of God, but are in our Rr



In meditation 4, the question of what the Will is is addressed.



> Although it still contains errors…
