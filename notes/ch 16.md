# ch 16
## savages

## The Noble Savage
- Romantic thinkers often greatly interested in non0WEstern cultures
- Many argued against colonialism as it repressed political freedom, was violently enforced, and did not agree with the cultural imperialism of the West
- Rousseau developed idea of the "Noble Savage

## ch 16
- can be seen as satirising the idea of the noble savage
- can be seen as also satirising the idea which colonial powers had of viewing these cultures as more savage (they only try to kill 2 people who killed and intruded on their territory, compared to the massive violence of the european wars; they treat candide much better than the europeans do after they forgive him)


- "what would...Pangloss say if he could see now how man lives in a state of nature"

- Cacambo suggests cannibalism is not inherently wrong
  - it is less wasteful
  - it may be necessary
- Voltaire also argues for this separately
