# Omnipotence

## Questions

is what god wills good, or good what god wills?



## Notes

1. Anything
2. Anything logically possible (in the world/in human terms)—limits god to humans
3. Anything logically possible for a perfect being, God can do. (in terms of the divine)—pins god to a nature of god we don't understand.

### What powers does God possess?:

- personal agency: one acting upon other people

- create ex nihilo



### Problems of omnipotence

rock

can god do evil—euthryphro. Jack disagrees with dilemma.



— BUT

Transcendence.

OR

Kierkegaard: faith saves God. This problem of language rests on a premise of knowledge. different to transcendence because of a leap of faith: we claim knowledge we cannot know and accept is as true by stepping out of the current knowledge paradigm.



Transcendence is not a property of god, it is a property of humans.

### Can and cannot

- not having the power
- having the power, but not experience or knowledge
- outside will power
- outside moral capability
