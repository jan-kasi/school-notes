# 33 Ragland Paper Descartes' Theodicy
## Paper Notes
> Abstract: In the Fourth Meditation, Descartes asks: If God is no deceiver, why do we sometimes err?' Descartes's answer (despite initial appearances) is both systematic and necessary for his epistemological project. Two atheistic arguments from error purport to show that reason both proves and disproves God's existence. Descartes must block them to escape scepticism. He offers a mixed theodicy: the value of free will justifies God in allowing our actual errors, and the perfection of the universe may justify God in making us able to err. Though internally coherent, Descartes's theodicy conflicts with his view of divine providence.

Most of M4 presents a theodicy in response to the problem of error.
At first glance it seems unsystematic and unnecessary.

Paper will argue that it is relatively unified and systematic, contributing "substantially to the Philosophical progress of the *Meditations*"

### Descartes' Problem of error
At the end of M3, Descartes' takes himself to have proven God (an omniperfect being). God has all perfections and lacks all imperfections; God cannot be a deceiver. God therefore wouldn't give us a faulty faculty/deceive us.
Descartes' identifies a problem that this seems to imply one never goes wrong, which seems wrong. Descartes' insists this gives us "no call to doubt" God's existence (partly defined as creator of all things [see Miner]) and it is "impossible to imagine" God being a deceiver as this would be self-contradictory.

Analogous to Augustine's problem in *On Free Choice of the Will*:
1. If there were an omniperfect God, He would cause everything in me.
2. An omniperfect God would not cause error.
3. So, if there were an omniperfect God, there would be no error in me.
4. There is error in me.
5. So, there is no omniperfect God

Descartes' responds by looking for the source of error, and finding that it isn't God.

By M4, Descartes' is confident that God's nature would prevent him giving one a deceptive nature, therefore this calls into question God's existence.

​	a. An omniperfect being would not allow even occasional error.
​	b. There is occasional error.
​	c. So, there is no omniperfect being.

Causal argument: merely assumes God would not cause error
This argument: God would not even allow anyone else to cause error

> not merely *evidential* arguments aiming to show that God's existence is very improbable on the available evidence, but *logical* arguments aiming to show that God's existence is impossible (given error)

1. Descartes' seems to reject probabilistic reasoning, "hold back my assent from opinions which are not completely certain and indubitable"

2. Descartes' takes himself to have demonstrated God's existence a posteriori. If it only calls this into question as unlikely then they do not need to call the previous M3 conclusions into doubt

Descartes' cannot have both be true logical arguments as this would lead to an "antimony of pure reason", reason cannot prove from CDP a contradiction that God both does and doesn't exist.
Descartes' needs to construct a theodicy that reason is reliable, God truly exists, and hence all CDPs are true.

### Descartes' general strategy and eternal truths

Descartes notes that 4 and b of the general argument isn't strictly speaking true:
> error as such is not something real which depends on God, but merely a defect

Error is absence of knowledge.
"error is not a pure negation," i.e. not the pure absence of a property, "but a privation or lack of some knowledge which somehow should be in me."
The nature of God means that he wouldn't have placed some imperfect faculty in us or a faculty which lacks a perfection it should have.
God is not obligated to give any creature all perfections there are, and doing so is logically impossible (as necessary existence is a perfection for Descartes' but cannot be 'given')
It's fine for God to make a creature with **negations** (absence of something), but not **privations** (absence of something which is required to make it perfect of its kind).

God could allow error for a morally sufficient reason (MSR).
> An MSR for some error E would be a good (which outweighs E) that God could not instantiate without allowing E, or an evil (as bad or worse than E) that God could not avoid without allowing E

Descartes' needs to show that it's possible for God to have an MSR for allowing error to block the claim that God and error cannot possibly coexist. "He does not need to prove an *actual* MSR, and so can draw on theological assumptions without proof."

Theodicy rests on assumption that some possible goods are such that an omnipotent being could not realise them without allowing error; this seems to clash with the claim that the "eternal truths" of maths, logic, morality, so on and so forth, have been laid down by God and depend on him entirely no less than the rest of creation. God has the power to make contradictions true under what E.M Curley calls the standard interpretation of the creation doctrine.

This means that this is simply one more part of D's project which needs to be interpreted in isolation form the standard interpretation like many others (as if something false could be true, then anything is possible)

Nonetheless the standard interpretation is probably wrong.
Descartes' denies that 'God could have made P false' entails ' p is not necessarily true'
Mathematical truths are eternal, immutable, and necessary despite being freely created by God. "because [God] willed that the three angles of a triangle should necessarily equal two right angles that this is true and cannot be otherwise; and so on in other case"

D draws a distinction between what God could do and what God can now do.

For D: God's creation of eternal truths is simply a brute fact beyond good and evil precisely because it establishes the meanings of 'good' and 'evil'. The idea of good did not impel God to chose one thing over another, this objection following that God is therefore not perfectly good id he could have created the standards of goodness such that evils do not get goods makes the assumption that the act by which God creates moral standards could itself be subject to moral evaluation (prior to? how about after the fact?).

### The big picture
D adopts the 'skeptical theist' position, he assumes that even if he cannot understand why God allows error, it is still possible that God has an MSR for doing so.
The next sentence appears to show he is not thinking systematically as he immediately undertakes an investigation into a possible MSR after saying it is rash to do so. He says we must look at the whole universe, not just the individual created thing; Descartes claims that, for all we know, our imperfection somehow increases the perfection of the whole universe.
This seems to appeal to the principle of organic unities: the intrinsic value of a whole is neither identical with nor proportional to the sum of the values of its parts. Descartes' seems to believe this is actually true from his letter to Mersenne.
Descartes' does not yet know for sure that he is a part in a universe of other things, so this is a possible MSR.

This may block the general argument from error, but doesn't show that God is not the cause of error. The increase of perfection by allowing error may even seem to provide a sufficient reason to directly cause us to err.

Descartes' goes to put the cause on free will to address the causal argument.

### Free will

Judgement consists of two causes: the intellect which puts forward various propositions for affirmation or denial, and the will or "faculty of choice" which "simply consists in our ability to do or not so something (that is, to affirm or deny, to pursue or avoid).
Both the will and intellect are perfect in their kind.

The "scope of the will is wider than that of the intellect", it extends to anything which can be an object of any will. The scope of will is infinite, but the scope of understanding -- clear and distinct understanding -- is finite. Therefore free creatures can pass judgement on any proposition even if it isn't perceived clearly, we have the "freedom to assent or not to assent" to what we perceive obscurely; we misuse this freedom by making judgements when we shouldn't (links to akrasia?).
We cause ourselves to err [see previous notes on M4]. So God is not in the strict and positive sense the cause of errors.
So 1. of the causal argument is false, some things in us are not caused by God. Nonetheless everything "comes from" God or *depends* on God's concurrence.

Whether my choice is good or ill, it is still an act of free will, and as such is something good. God has an MSR for concurring with our bad decisions: in doing so, God gives us freedom which is a "supreme perfection in man"

### Back to the big picture

The free-will theodicy doesn't fully address the general argument even if it blocks the causal argument.
D must provide an MSR for God to make creatures like us when God could have made us 'more perfect'.

Descartes suggests the intellect is necessarily finite in scope and the will necessarily infinite. It is logically impossible to make a human whose will doesn't outstrip her clear and distinct intellect. But God could have simply have made it much larger than it actually is, it doesn't need to be infinite to cover any issue we might deliberate on to minimise error.
D returns to the big-picture theodicy to claim that even though God could have made me more perfect, one cannot deny that there could in some way be more perfection in the universe as a whole because some of its parts are not immune from error while others are immune.

Descartes' takes the big-picture theodicy to only justify that we are *able* (due to our limited intellects) to err, not the fact that we *actually do* err. So it doesn't justify that there can be erroneous clear and distinct judgements or ideas or perceptions. As while we can't know  God's purposes, we know that some purposes do not belong to God (e.g. malicious purpose). If God designed us such that we formed false beliefs which couldn't be corrected by clearer judgements or natural faculties God would be acting out of malice (perhaps privation link to justify).
God is bound to show a certain amount of goodness to creatures: even if God could show false CDP to make the universe more perfectly overall, he would not do it.

### A problem for Descartes' theodicy

It is systematic and internally coherent, but also important for his epistemological project. It is mixed, appealing to two different MSRs:
1. MSR for allowing our actual errors is freedom
2. MSR for making us capable of error could be making the universe as a whole more perfect

1 and 2 together seem to show it is possible for error and God to coexist. This blocks the general argument from error.

Issue about free will and God pre-ordaining all of history. (not sure if the following section applies to the Meditations on its own)
