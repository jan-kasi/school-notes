# 23 Meditation 3
## p29-30 Categories of thought

"But what about..."
- Descartes classifies thought into 3 kinds:
  1. Ideas
   - "some of my thoughts are as it were images of things"
  2. The Will and emotions, plus volitions
   - "a particular thing which I take as the object of my thought, but my thought includes something more than the likeness of this thing". A different form of thought in which the idea is made the object of some volition/emotion
  3. Judgements
   - Similar to volitions or emotions in that an idea is the object of thought, but instead it is judged as something (does this correspond to formal reality?) instead of simply held.

### Type 1. Ideas

Descartes hold they cannot "strictly speaking be false" so long as they "are considered solely in themselves and I do not refer them to anything else". "For whether it is a goat or a chimera I imagine, it is just as true that I imagine the former as the latter" [imagines both a chimera and a goat the same].

Ideas "considered solely in themselves", no issue of falsity for D
- They are simply concepts held in the mind in some way
- They are just what they are

|Idea|Reality|Origin|
|--|--|--|
|Innate|Formal, a priori|Infinite substance|
|Adventitious|Representational, a posteriori|Secondary qualities. Properties/Modes combined with the finite (can't directly experience extension, but can infer the primary quality [Wax Arg]). Come from sense perception|
|Factitious| Representational, a posteriori, come from adventitious|Secondary qualities. Properties/Modes combined with the finite (can't directly experience extension, but can infer the primary quality [Wax Arg]). Come from other ideas (combined)|

#### Innate ideas
Innate concept thesis
Ideas which seemingly originate from the individual independent of the mind.
Idea of what thinking is, the infinite
#### Adventitious ideas
Ideas originating from representational reality (sensory perception) independent of the mind
Idea of heat, colour, the moon
#### Factitious ideas
Ideas originating from other ideas, put together by the mind
Idea of "sirens, hippogriffs, and the like"

### Type 2. The Will and Emotions

The Will is simply free will, it is part of the process of thought. God given faculty/ability to chose.

Emotions, wants and needs. Natural innate part of you which erupts and wants things.

Volitions, are things which comes from your soul. Part of the way you are designed by God. Will spontaneously appear and affect.



Internal.

### Type 3. Judgements

D: A judgement is is something corresponds to reality, is it true?

A combination of type 1 and type 2 thoughts to form judgements.

Trying to compare representational to formal reality.

## Clear and Distinct Perceptions

p31 

> But the chief question at this point concerns the ideas which I take to be derived from things existing outside me: what is my reason for thinking that they resemble these things

WILL= capacity of the mind to freely choose what to believe



NATURAL LIGHT/ LIGHT OF REASON = The faculty of intuition (intellectual seeing) aided by the light of rationality. i.e. it gives truths which are clear and (if not confused with any other ideas,) distinct.



CLEAR AND DISTINCT PERCEPTIONS = Those which can be intuited by the mind by means of reason alone
