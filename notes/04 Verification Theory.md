# 04 Verification Theory

> A proposition is said to be verifiable, in the strong sense of the term, if, and only if, its truth could be conclusively established in experience.
But it is verifiable, in the weak sense, if it is possible for experience to render it probable

—Ayer, *Language, Truth and Logic*, 1971

Inductive reasoning is never conclusive in the strong verification test but it is in the weak one.

### Issues with verification

- almost anything can pass the weak verification test, we only need for it to be probable that it could happen
  - JFK was assassinated by the government; JFK was assassinated by the mafia; JFK was assassinated by a random person; all of these can pass the weak verification test
- can *anything* pass the strong verification theory?
- the verification principle fails its own test; it doesn't pass the strong verification, and arguably the opposite can pass the weak one


- Ayer argues that strong verification is impossible
- our senses can always deceive us therefore we can never conclusively make any statements about the world
- Ayer points out that historical statements and the general conclusions of science would be unverifiable:
> It will be our contention that no proposition, other than a tautology, can possibly be more than a probable hypothesis. And if this is correct, the principle that a sentence can be factually significant only if it expresses what is conclusively verifiable is self-stultifying as a criterion of significance. For it leads to the conclusion that it is impossible to make a significant statement of fact at all.

—Ayer, *Language, Truth and Logic*, 1971

### Ayer’s corrections

To correct the strong/weak verification issue, Ayer suggested the following distinction:

- Directly verifiable—verifiable by observation, e.g. water boils at 100 C
- Indirectly verifiable—verified if other directly verifiable evidence supports it, e.g. atoms are made of x,y and z

Ayer also introduced the idea of *practical verifiability and verifiability in principle*:
- Practical verifiability—things which can be tested and verified now, e.g. water boils at 100°C
- Verifiability in principle—things which *could* be tested and verified now but there is a physical issue obstructing us, e.g. gravitational waves in Einstein’s times, dark matter now



### Problems:

Verification in principle: could anything become possible?

- It used to be thought impossible to cross the ocean, to fly, to leave the planet, to reach the moon, other planets, etc. but all of these happened.

- Non-cognitive language?

### Implications for Religious Language

- “I have experienced God” is non-cognitive 

- If anyone can believe this directly, anyone can experience it indirectly

However, “there exists a transcendent God” has no literal significance. Any statements about God are nonsense. Atheism, theism, and agnosticism are all nonsense.
