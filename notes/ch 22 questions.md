# ch 22 questions
Class answers in *, mine in paragraph

1.
How does the tone change in this chapter compared to the ones preceding it? E.g. more/less realistic, satirical, etc 
- More realistic, rather than fantastical (e.g. Eldorado and the use of myth/legend), satire based on real, rather than speculative, events 
- More believable and relatable and therefore more satirical 
- Candide’s optimism as he arrives in France and is undermined by the anticlimactic, bathetic nature of Paris itself 

The tone changes to much more satirical and realistic in the apparent normality of events. Whereas before Candide was in Eldorado and flaunting his money after he left, now he is in Paris and being cheated of his money in a very obvious way. It is more realistic in that Candide's misfortunes are more believably simple and more satirical because of this. The contrast between the two modes of realism allow Voltaire's current satire of Optimism and society to be just as effective but more believable.

2.
How are Martin and Candide's philosophical differences shown in this chapter? 
- Candide still clings to optimistic hope of finding Cunegonde – counterintuitive? 
- Martin sees the scams in Paris as foreshadowing future evil, unlike Candide who sees his reunion with her as a source of hope and restoration 
- Candide’s innocence/naivete shown throughout this chapter – too trusting 

When both Martin and Candide exclaim, "That is a lot," to the corresponding numbers of five to six thousand and fifteen to sixteen plays. This shows how Candide stays in awe at everything, only wanting to know the overall picture, and Martin has a very pessimistic and uninterested view on identifying the bad parts and expecting very little good to remain.

3.
How is the abbe presented and satirised in this section of the novel? 
- Embodies the trickery and theatrical deceit of Paris. Despite being from a good background, he still longs for wealth, fame, influence (as do the other Parisian characters) 
- Difference between helpful exterior and true motives 
- His association with the church suggests the underlying desire for power and wealth, even in those in religious roles 
- Taking advantage of Candide, e.g. takes a cut of Candide’s losses when gambling, fake Cunegonde scheme, stealing Candide’s jewels 

The abbe is presented as wanting to con Candide of his money throughout their entire interaction. Even while he is entertaining Candide and Martin he is attempting to appear more respectable, "not the man to effect an introduction...Mademoiselle Clairon moved only in superior circles" yet lies about her being "occupied" to not appear as inferior and even seem acquainted with her, and he only takes an interest in Candide for his money. He pretends to want Candide to experience Paris but takes him to lose 50 000 francs and coaxes him into revealing everything he needs to stage Cunegonde's illness. This satires the abbe as only being interested in personal gain and lying his way to gain influence and money, even more so as he is well known to the Marquise and presumably has done this with her before.

"Take any contradiction or inconsistency you can imagine, and you will find examples of it in the government, the courts, the churches and the theatres of this ridiculous nation." (p.61-2) What examples of this behaviour do we see in this chapter?
- Satire/attacks on all institutions, such as the Church 
- Undermines Candide’s optimistic view of Paris 
- Undermines the views of Enlightenment that man is inherently orderly and reasonable 
- Attacks low quality of Parisian plays, suggesting they are motivated by easiness and money 

The officer who comes to arrest the "suspicious foreigners" and later releases Martin and Candide on a bribe is an example. Even more when he says,  "had you committed every imaginable crime, you are still the most honourable" and releases him after being given three diamonds.
The theatre-goers who criticise the play and the actors and then criticise people who criticise art and theatre is another example and a satire of the hypocrisy of  the snobbery in art circles.

5.
How does Voltaire present the literary and intellectual worlds of Paris? 
- Participants are motivated by self-interest, rather than intellectual merit and what will benefit society 
- Supposed ‘intellectuals’ still ready to take advantage of Candide 
- Motivated by wealth and corruption, just like everyone else  
- Candide and Martin ignored until their wealth is known 
- The most intelligent thing they do is creating scams to extort money from others 
- Underwhelming, unextraordinary dinner is aggrandised by the arrogance of the characters 

Voltaire presents them as highly hypocritical and stifling, and that most of them are simply sophists trying to appear clever and pass the time in privileged circles. This is exemplified in the phrase, "insipid witticisms, false news, pointless argument, a little politics and a quantity of slander". Voltaire satirises the pretentiousness of the literary and intellectual worlds of criticising for the sake of slandering a person's name and as being mostly a money-making venue rather than an intellectual one, especially the Saloons.

6.
As he leaves France, Candide feels like "a man delivered from hell". What is so hellish about France in Voltaire's opinion? Think about how French society is presented throughout this chapter. 
- Salon as a microcosm of French society – everyone is out for money and self-interested, e.g. the government, individuals 
- Voltaire’s exile from France reflected in his negative presentation of the country 

Candide experiences almost the opposite to what he experiences in Eldorado.
He purposefully wants to arrive at France and visit Paris because everyone he meets is going there, in Eldorado he simply needed to keep travelling in the hope of arriving anywhere better than where he was. Candide is treated with hospitality and meets the most prominent members of society in Eldorado even though he is money-less and never has to pay, whereas in France he is unable to meet anyone in "superior circles", is treated with false and half-given hospitality to rob him, and has to pay much money even though he is very rich and can lose 50 000 francs without much thought. He also has to pay to leave and would've been forced to stay in the "darkest" cell, while in Eldorado he stayed at the palace and the King had engineers build an extraordinary and expensive method for them to leave. By contrasting Eldorado and France in this way, Voltaire satirises the hypocrisy, pedantry, and rudeness of French society in its many disputes between everyone.
