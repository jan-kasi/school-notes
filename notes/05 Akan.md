# 05 Akan

(interesting version of theological determinism)

- meta-ethnicity



- (nuanced theological determinism)

- *Okra*, the soul, contains destiny of the individual
- Akan proverbs—encompass their beliefs:
  - no bypass to God’s destiny
  - if a piece of wood remains in a river for thousands of years it cannot become a crocodile
    - things remain as they are
  - we offer advice, but we do not change destiny
  - one is not born with a “bad head” but one takes it on earth
  - if a man is unhappy, his conduct is the cause
- Observations about destiny
- Anything that is named must be presumed to be real
  - language and metaphysics
- Patterns in human life provides evidence for destiny
- Uniqueness of *Okra* means there is individuality and different destiny
- Destiny, or the message (*nkra*), outlines only the broader outlines of one’s life. Even though every decision will lead to the final destination, we still have room for free will
- Every person’s destiny is ***good***



- deterministic conception of the world
  - we are still capable of free will even though our lives are predetermined prior to our experience
    - certain events are outside human intervention, but this doesn’t infringe on free will
    - one’s spirit can be developed

Uniqueness of *okra* means there is individuality and different destiny
