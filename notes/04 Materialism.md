# 04 Materialism



| Term          | Definition                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Behaviourism  | Position that humans should be understood by their external actions, not mental thoughts |
| Cognition     | Mental activity and processes: thinking, remembering, etc.   |
| Functionalism | Position that mind can be explained fully by its functions   |
| Materialism   | Position that everything is formed of matter and nothing else exists |
| Phenomena     | Appearances or experiences, objects as they appear to the observer. Phenomenology is the philosophical study of these |
| Physicalism   | Position that everything is physical, there is nothing else  |
| Naturalism    | Position that reality can and should be explained through natural processes and scientific laws, not with the supernatural |
| Neuroscience  | Scientific study of the brain                                |
| Reductionism  | Process of fully explaining something in terms of other ideas or phenomena; reducing the mind to explainable factors |

### Naturalism

- leads to monism
- gradual development in knowledge
- arguments abstracted from real world experience have little value as the individual is assumed to be part of the physical world
- philosophy needs to support and clarify neuroscience

## Functionalism

—Daniel C. Dennett

The mind can be defined by its capabilities, it is nothing more than a collection of processes and functions

The attempt to understand the mind through its functions in a coherent and satisfactory way is called **functionalism**

Different from behaviourism in looking at mental states as distinct from mental states: you can have private thoughts and personal imagination. These things will be real to the functionalist.

Functionalism doesn’t propose that the mind and brain are the same.

It is about the way the mental functions happen, not the physical matter they manifest in.

The mind is not a particular type of physical/non-physical thing. It is a way of talking about collected capabilities which *happen* to manifest in brains, but could possibly do so in other ways.

Different from the **identity theory** of mind which identifies the mind with the brain exactly.

It is reasonable to suppose the same functions could be replicated or transferred between systems. So the mind is transferable between different realisations.

Avoid the problem of narrowly assigning the mind as part of anatomy or as a special entity,

Dennett, *Consciousness explained*

- Although it isn’t possible to see inside someone’s mind, it is possible to study experiences and compare them
- We shouldn’t treat phenomenology as dealing with something unknown. It is possible to study what someone else experiences are like—heterophenomenology—and in doing so consider that we could know something about experiences or consciousness.
- The first-person experiences of the individual need to be acknowledged by philosophy (against behaviourism)
- However, they need to be studied scientifically with the third-person
- Functionalism considers what the mind does by scientifically discussing what experiences are like
- There is nothing *to* the mind beyond the various systems, e.g. sight
  - We need to reject the Cartesian view. There is no other soul inside who “sees” what the eyes process, and the mind itself does not “see” this either
  - Cartesian Theatre: Descartes’ view is like a belief in a homunculus watching tiny movies inside a theatre, but this is an infinite cycle; there must be something inside this thing to absorb the experiences, and inside that, and so on
  - ![illustrated example of the Cartesian Theatre](../attachments/ctheatre.jpeg)
- Consciousness isn’t a mystery and heterophenomenology is a method for studying it
- Instead of thinking of consciousness as pure experiences of phenomena, they are something distinct
- Consciousness is just the collective accumulation of impressions and actions
- the idea of *having* a mind is just the product of such a sophisticated system of acknowledging its own processes.

## Consciousness

### Functionalism and the problem of other minds

Functionalism tells us it’s possible to know the mind of another human being even if we cannot re-experience their exact experiences ourselves. The experience of what it is like to be *you* is very similar to the experience of what it is to be *me* so far as the conscious experience of functions shouldn’t be too different.

This makes a claim about the problem of other minds.

An argument from analogy:

1. Other humans seem very similar to me
2. The presence of many similarities implies a fundamental similarity
3. I have a mind
4. Therefore, other humans have minds

Problems from analogy—i.e. how much is enough?—, philosophical zombies, premise 2 can be questioned, is the conclusion the same mind as my own, etc.

Dennett tries to propose that heterophenomenology allows us to know other minds. 

### Chalmers and the hard problem of consciousness

Chalmers is sceptical about functionalism’s ability to identify the existence of other minds or to give knowledge of them.

He defines consciousness as *the subjective quality of existence*. This is similar to other positions in philosophy of consciousness being something *which it is like to be*.

- > A mental state is conscious if there is something it is like to be in that mental state

  —Chalmers, *The Conscious Mind* (1996)

Even if we knew everything about how the system works, there would still be no reason to suppose that system is conscious.

Distinguishes between the *phenomenal* and *psychological* aspects of the mind.

- Phenomenal: the state of experiencing things
- Psychological: the behaviour and way of experiencing things

Chalmers finds an issue in functionalism in confusing the phenomenal and psychological: it tries to analyse all mental states in terms of what they do.

The question of if someone *processes* colour in a certain way is different from the question of if a person *experiences* colour in a certain way.

Chalmers argues that the first-person experience of what something is *like for me* is conceptually different from the study of mental processes.

Functionalism, for Chalmers, focuses on the psychological mind-body problem. This is the **easy problem of consciousness**, the question of why we do what we do and how. However, the **hard problem of consciousness**, why mental states are conscious at all, is required for a complete explanation of the mind and body. Functionalism doesn’t do this for Chalmers, it only explains psychological aspect of the mind as being explained by a collection of functions which can be understood with scientific advances— advances towards solving the easy problem.

The link with the body is more a question of *why* the mind gives rise to consciousness, not how and what consciousness is and works: why does the mind produce *what it is like* to experience and why is there something *it is like to be* in the first place.

Philosophical zombies:

- You know what these are: no qualia or experience of what it is like to be; there is nothing it is like to be to be a PZ. However, they are otherwise entirely identical to humans and function in the same ways; it behaves perfectly as if it has consciousness/qualia but does not
- It would be logically possible for them to exist, even if we don’t believe they *do* exist
- Therefore a complete understanding of the mind as a functioning system is not enough and does nothing to “explain” consciousness, because consciousness (there being something it is like to be that) is not necessary for the system to function
- This could be replaced with something like a computer simulating all the functions perfectly as described above: while for a functionalist this means it would be a mind/“conscious” and consciousness/mind transfer is therefore possible (the mind can be realised in different ways), for Chalmers it is not. There is no reason to suppose that the system is conscious, there might be nothing it is like to be that simulation

Chalmers tries to distance himself from earlier strands of dualism. He argues it is possible to say that materialism is false but still adhere to naturalism.

He suggests even though the mind might not be able to be explained physically, it may still be possible to develop some other framework without any mysterious entity of mind.

Chalmers suggests that mind/consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe like mass or time, it cannot be reduced to other, simpler, explanations.
