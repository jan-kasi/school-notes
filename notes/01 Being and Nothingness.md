# 01 Being and Nothingness

***—An essay on phenomenological ontology***

## Introduction

- An ontological analysis of human existence using the phenomenological method

- Exposed to ideas of Husserl and Heidegger at the French Institute in Berlin.
    - Discovered phenomenology—”the study of structure of the structures of experience in consciousness.”
- Published “Nausea”.
    - Thought that the medium of the novel helped to understand philosophical problems in a different way as a treatise.
- Published during German occupation of France and after having served in the army.
- “Existence precedes essence”

***

## Nothingness

Husserl, The intentionality thesis: ”all thought is intentional” (nature of thought thought is directed to/about objects).

- Sartre thinks this has unintended consequences:

“\[Sartre thinks there is no\] transcendental ego in the sense of an *a priori* structure of consciousness that predetermines the unity of beliefs and perceptions.”—Joseph Catalano, *Good Faith and Other Essays* (1990), p. 135

- **Sartre doesn’t deny the existence of an ego, he denies there is an ego behind consciousness as a subject.**

  > The consciousness which says ‘I think’ is precisely not the consciousness which thinks.

   —Sartre, *Transcendence of the Ego*

Only by **reflecting on the activity as one’s own** does the ego come into existence **as the intentional object of consciousness**. The ego presupposes consciousness; the self-known presupposes the self-knowing.

- It is by acting that we establish identity and allow external demands to shape our action:

  - |                        NOT                        |                             YES                              |
    | :-----------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
    | “they keep secrets because they are trustworthy.” | “We call someone trustworthy because they *have* kept our secrets.” |

- > Existence precedes essence

    - the kind of existence which precedes is ambiguous and insecure: the Socratic injunction (“know thyself”) is an impossible ideal as it is only through action that the self is defined.

- Sartre’s strong metaphysical theses about consciousness and its objects in his introduction are essential for almost all of the claims he makes.

> \[Consciousness\] is a being such that in its being, its being is in question as so far as this being implies a being other than itself.

> \[Unlike being, which\] is itself so completely that the perpetual reflection which constitutes the self is dissolved in an identity… the being of the for-itself is defined, on the contrary, as being what it is not and not being what it is.

 —*Being and Nothingness*, 18, 21

- Sartre distinguishes between being-for-itself (consciousness) and being-in-itself (fixed and static, e.g. the being-in-itself of a bookcase).

  - | Being-for-itself | Being-in-itself  |
    | ---------------- | ---------------- |
    | Consciousness    | Unthinking world |
    | Fluid, Changing  | Static           |





- **Negation is a distinct human action.**

  - Negation is “a refusal of existence.”

  - Every time we make a choice, by affirming one thing we negate others.

  - The being-for-itself is separated from the being-in-itself (unthinking world) by its unique power of negation. through humanity nothingness can arrive into the world.

  - The unique psychological ability to negate is dependant on an underlying ontology (theory about the nature of being and existence)

    - > The necessary condition for our saying not is that non-being be a perpetual presence in us and outside of us, that nothingness haunts being.

        —*Being and Nothingness*, 35

- **Sartre thinks there are several negative realities (e.g. absence, repulsion, otherness ) that are experienced by humans which make them seem as more than nothing.**

  - **Sartre calls these, “Négatité”.**

***

## Anxiety

- Nothingness, outside and within us, conditions our questions about being.

- Nothingness is not-existent.

- However, the Négaitité is experienced by humans.

  - We make the nothingness be through or experience.
  - Therefore there must be a being which nihilates, which brings the nothingness to things.
  - The human, as the being which brings nothingness into the world, must be its own nothingness.
  - What must the human be in its being such that through it nothingness comes into being?
    - Man must be free.
- The lived experience of freedom implies a nothingness, it is experienced as its nihilation of the self’s past being.

- Anxiety reveals freedom as the possible destroyer of the self’s present and future of what it is.

- Anxiety is anxiety before oneself, it has no object.

- It is the fear at the freedom which one has and can be with respect to one’s self.

- Anxiety is the consciousness of freedom.

- Anxiety shows the shortcoming of Cartesian epistemology.

  - If the “I” of the “I think” is the structure of consciousness, this anxiety is impossible.
  - However, with the disjunction of the self and the self-knowing: the previous “I” of the past is powerless in the face of the “I” of the present.
- Consciousness confronts its past and future as facing the self, which it is in the mode of not being.

- Freedom manifests itself by anxiety—characterised by a necessity to constantly remake the self.

- Man is always separated by a nothingness from its essence.

- This anxiety is uncomfortable, so one attempts to hides it from oneself through flight:

|                  Psychological determinism                   |                         Distraction                          |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| An attitude of excuse. Essence is fixed, it provides a nature which is productive of one’s acts. This is reassuring as it gives one an excuse. | We detach ourselves from our possibilities by considering them abstractly. |
| We deny our transcendence, preferring to take our place in the order of things (being-in-itself) instead of freedom. | We redefine something as an abstract idea not our own possibility. |



- Distraction is a more complete form of flight.

- Nature of consciousness accounts for freedom and nothingness but also requires it’s questioning

- We never face nothingness directly as a thing so anxiety has nothing as its object

***

## Bad Faith

> For man to be able to question, he must be capable of being his own nothingness

—*Being and Nothingness*

- Anxiety shows one’s freedom.

- Bad faith is different to lying.

  - Lying is to deceive from the other and being aware of it.
  - Bad faith is lying to oneself and concealing the self from the self.

- > What must be the being of man if he is capable of bad faith?

- **Double property of the human being:**

  - **Humans are both a facticity and a transcendence.**

- > Bad faith seeks to affirm their identity while preserving their differences. It must affirm facticity as being transcendence and transcendence as being facticity, in such a way that at the instant when a person apprehends the one, he can find himself abruptly faced with the other.

    —*Being and Nothingness*, 79

    - Bad faith can be two forms:
      - Deny the freedom/transcendence component (“I can’t do anything about it”)
      - Ignore the factical part of all situations (“I can do anything by wishing it”)

- Bad faith takes us to the root of the problem, the subject of identity.

- Bad faith would not be possible if humans are what they are (their authentic self)

- We hide our freedom from ourselves by accepting the definitions of others, e.g. “I am a waiter”

- Bad faith is belief for self-deception.

## The Body

- Sartre wanted to differentiate between different levels of ontology.
  - He believed his predecessors had misunderstood the body by confusing the orders of knowing and being.



- Level1: The body as being-for-itself
- Level2: The body for the others
- Level3: Third Ontological Dimension of the body



| 1—The body as being-for-itself                               | 2—The body for the Other                                     | 3—Third Ontological Dimension of the body                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| “My body as it is for me does not appear to me in the midst of the world.” | The body as seen rather than lived.                          | We experience our body as reflected by other’s experiences of it. |
| Not something we can intuit as an object.                    | The body is a tool for the engagement with the world.        | “The Other is revealed to me as the subject for whom I am an object.” |
| I *am* my body, NOT I have a body.                           | It appears as a thing, so one is a thing.                    | “I cannot be embarrassed by my own body as I exist it. It is my body as it may exist for the other which may embarrass me.” |
| To be the foundation of one’s own nothingness.               | The Other’s body appears as an object.                       | The Gaze of the Other, “le regarde”.                         |
| Bodies are the axis of the relationship of the for-itself and the being for-others. | The studying of another's body and one’s own body as objects are one and the same. | We are imprisoned by the gaze of the other, the other reprieves us of control over how we see our world and ourselves. |
| The body is the centre.                                      | The realisation that bodies are a thing reveals the 3rd level. | This is a reason for accepting another’s identity in bad faith instead of being one’s authentic self. |

## The Look

- *Individual level*: Through negation I can chose what I can be.
- *Social level:* My freedom is only one of many freedoms, and my being is subject to the Other’s power of negation.
- “I am not the only being by which nothingness comes into the world.”
- The Other makes one no longer the centre.
- Just as the Other “steals the world”, the Other can steal “my being”
  - The gaze of the other reveals that one’s consciousness is not the only deciding factor of who one is. As there is another perspective which decides one’s essence.
  - Example of person peeping through a keyhole. “I am my actions”, there is no jealousy or shame—that comes after the gaze of the other.
- The self-known is always indeterminate as it is always subject to the freedom of others.
- The Other limits the self’s freedom.
- “In the Look there is a death of my possibilities”

## Freedom

- Radical Freedom
- Success is not important to freedom

|                    |                     Ontological Freedom                      | Situational Freedom                               |
| :----------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------- |
| French Occupation: | Ontological freedom (of consciousness and thought, attitude) is not limited. | Situational freedom is limited (of actions, etc.) |

- No matter of situational freedom, at the level of consciousness we are ultimately free.
