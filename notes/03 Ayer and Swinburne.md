# 03 Ayer and Swinburne

## AJ Ayer, *God Talk is Evidently Nonsense*

##### More notes on next sheet

- Saying "God exists" means more than just certain things happening in certain sequences, it is more than just regularity in the universe.
  - If it were only that, then it would be acceptable.
- "God exists" means much more to the theist
  - It is talking of a transcendent being who might be known through empirical manifestations but cannot be defined by those.
- In this case, God is a metaphysical term. Ayer thinks this is meaningless.

- There cannot be any transcendental religious truths, the sentences used by theists are literally meaningless.

- If the theist admits the object of faith cannot be described/is intelligible/transcendent, then they must also admit they're bound to talk nonsense when describing God.

- Knowing things but being unable to express them is not knowing the proofs

- If one asserts they "experienced God" as experiencing religious emotion then it must be true.
  - However, when one says this they ordinarily do not only mean that they're experiencing a religious emotion but that there exists a transcendent God.

"God exists" can neither be true or false, it is nonsense.
- Any belief or statement about God is nonsense: the atheist, agnostic, and theist positions are all nonsense

Practical verification and verification in principle, and direct and indirect verification

Introduces weak verification 

## Swinburne, *God-Talk is Evidently Not Nonsense*

- Criticises all the verification and falsification tests heavily with counter examples.

- You need to verify the possibility of meaning and truth with some other method *first*.
- The weak and strong falsification and verification theories are all flawed with counterexamples of meaningful statements which can be true or false but cannot be verified or falsified.
### Strong verification:

- shows all universal statements have no factual meaning. Since they do, the theory must be false
- this was the most influential argument in persuading the logical positivists to revise or abandon strong verification
- Universal Statement:
  - statement of the form "All A are B", where A is an open class (no matter how many you observe, there is likely another member)
  - e.g. "all ravens are black", "all material bodies on the surface of the earth experience c.32 ft/s^2 acceleration towards it"
### Falsifiability:

- Strong falsification: a factual statement has to be falsifiable *in principle* by an observation-statement
  - "All A are B" is falsified by finding an A which is not B.
- Universal statements are saved, but existential ones are not:
  - statement of something's existence
  - "there is, or was, or will be, a centaur/man with two heads"
  - no matter how many times you look, there is always the possibility of finding this
  - you cannot observe the non-existence of this, only the positive existence
  - therefore it is unfalsifiable, yet it contains factual statements

### verification/falsification

- either conclusively verifiable or falsifiable in principle by an observation statement
- this doesn't save a mixture of an existential and open ended class statement:
  - "all badgers are mortal"
  - you can't falsify this: however old a badger is, it might die the next day
  - you can't verify this: however old a badger is, it might *not* die the next day
- you cannot conclusively verify or falsify this statement, yet it contains factual information

### weak verification:
- statement is meaningful iff either it is itself an observation-statement, or there are observation-statement(s) which would confirm or disconfirm it
- by "confirm", it is meant "raise the probability of" or "count as evidence against"
This is the form which verification reaches in *Language, Truth and Logic*

Ayer seems to introduce the principle of weak verification as a definition of a "factual" or "synthetic" statement.

If so, the only objection which can be made to it is that it is misleading

- as a definition, there may be non-analytic propositions which are not synthetic
- a definition which allows this is not in accordance for normal philosophical usage and could be misleading

- at other times, Ayer seems to assume a meaningful statement which is non-analytic MUST be synthetic.
  - with this understanding, the weak verification principle is a further claim about synthetic statements. Swinburne states he will assume this generally assumed point going forwards:

Even if the statement were true it would not be very useful for sorting out factual statements from others
- a statement is factual iff it either describes a logically possible thing which is observable, or an other observable and logically possible thing would confirm or disconfirm it by observing it
- This is only useful if we agree on what is logically possible to observe or be.
  - things which be: this is hardly ever the case, and we are often wrong: e.g. crossing the sea or visiting the moon was thought logically impossible
  - things we can observe: someone turned into stone, a cell, an organelle, someone walking on water. People have agreed and disagreed these could be possible to observe.
- even if we could agree if a statement was an observation-statement, it is still an issue to show if something is **not** a factual statement
  - you would have to show it is not confirmable, *or* disconfirmable by *any* observation-statement. We can never really see *every* observation-statement in a list to compare across, we can easily get it wrong: we have to assume anyway

### Flaws with arguments in favour of weak verification principle:
By example, all examples of factual statements agree with the principle:
- Philosophical Zombies
  - unverifiable and unfalsifiable through observation, yet some hold it to be factual
  - PZ are indistinguishable from a person but do not have qualia, conscious experience, or sentience. There is "nothing it is like to be" a zombie (if we define consciousness as something it is like to be).
  - if something is exactly like a human and developed exactly like one in every possible way and is completely indistinguishable from one, there is no observation test you can conduct to see if the PZ *really* feels something when you sick a pin in them and they scream
  - some claim these to be factual, others don't
- i.e., counterexamples
It is claimed you cannot understand something without: knowing what it is like to observe it, or know which observations would count for or against it
It follows that a statement could not be factually meaningful unless it fits to the principle
- The premise seems false
  - someone can understand "the world was covered by sea before there were any rational beings" wihtout having any idea of the geological evidence for or against it or any idea how to establish this evidence

Swinburne concludes:
- there are no arguments for the weak verification principle which hold
- there is no reason to hold it
- even if it we had a reason and were able to apply it to credal statements (without begging crucial questions), he has shown there can be factually meaningful statements which cannot be verified or falsified by observation-statements
- even if it could be shown that credal statements didn't make observation-statements or statements which observation-statements could count for/against (which is improbable, and Swinburne doesn't want to suggest is *possible*) this wouldn't show they didn't make a factual statement
  - (without further argumentation)
- Verification doesn't provide principles which can be used for theological sentences
